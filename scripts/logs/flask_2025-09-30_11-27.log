[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  I introduced the standards one quiz per week, and it's going to take about four hours.
[00:07.000 --> 00:20.000]  So the quiz are due Monday evening on the 1st week, and they're less serious than I want.
[00:20.000 --> 00:23.000]  So I'm going to do a lot of the one-eights of like reading math.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  You know you're not going to do all these quiz, and the quiz is sort of according to plan,
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  and it's going to be done in about two days, so you have about a week to work on it.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  And then there will be a quiz in a few days.
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  Alright, you guys are good?
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  Thank you.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  I'm going to thank your person.
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.000]  I'm going to move into our sample.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  I gave you a simple painting of blackjack.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  You were spending a dollar.
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.000]  And if you get an ace card in your first few cards, you have an automatic natural 21.
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  You spent $1.50.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  How cool would it be to lose your tie in your $1.00 bet?
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  Okay, we're getting practice probably.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  And question one.
[01:15.000 --> 01:26.000]  I'm going to have you do this on your own.
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  But when you're not checking, you can do it now.
[01:45.000 --> 01:55.000]  I don't know.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  We won't test you on this.
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  Some of the blackjack.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  So it's not a math class.
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  I'm not too strict on notation.
[02:13.000 --> 02:24.000]  But this is a good, slightly casual way of writing that your application or your average is h times x and multiplied by probability of an average.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  And then you can do that.
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  And that gives you the information.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  And you can do that in a table.
[02:32.000 --> 02:39.000]  You can calculate x times px in a table.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  And then you can do it in other examples.
[02:44.000 --> 03:00.000]  And each of those is like a contribution or an expectation.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  So I'm going to add a base to 0.135.
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  I'm going to add a base to 0.35.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  0.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  Okay.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  And then.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  Okay.
[04:15.000 --> 04:30.000]  Okay.
[04:30.000 --> 04:47.000]  That looks like fucking.
[04:47.000 --> 05:02.000]  Okay.
[05:02.000 --> 05:11.000]  One dollar.
[05:11.000 --> 05:33.000]  Okay.
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  Real blackjack is a little more complicated.
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  And there are many different variations.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  Because you're allowed to split and double.
[05:45.000 --> 05:56.000]  But in the end, there is always what's called a negative.
[05:56.000 --> 06:11.000]  Okay.
[06:11.000 --> 06:33.000]  Okay.
[06:33.000 --> 07:00.000]  Okay.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  Okay.
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  Okay.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  Okay.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  So that was just a warm up for today.
[07:34.000 --> 07:55.000]  Just like you're able to calculate the variance and your deviation based on some numbers.
[07:55.000 --> 08:00.000]  Okay.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  Okay.
[08:03.000 --> 08:16.000]  Okay.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.600]  based on the order of what we've done in the past
[08:18.600 --> 08:22.100]  in incorporating, incorporating properties.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  So variance is not terrible, especially if you, well,
[09:41.200 --> 09:43.800]  this is kind of a standard table.
[09:43.800 --> 09:46.320]  So the way you calculate variance
[09:46.320 --> 09:48.400]  is very similar to the way you calculated it before.
[09:48.400 --> 09:51.560]  You take the difference from the average
[09:51.560 --> 09:53.960]  for each value you square it.
[09:53.960 --> 09:55.480]  So if the order of that is all up,
[09:55.480 --> 09:57.800]  you multiply that difference by the probability
[09:57.800 --> 10:00.200]  that happens to the variance.
[10:00.200 --> 10:02.600]  You do each part of the variance.
[10:02.600 --> 10:03.440]  You kind of did before,
[10:03.440 --> 10:07.000]  because things showed up multiple times in the variance.
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.760]  You would do each, like each time
[10:10.760 --> 10:12.320]  it starts to show up in the population
[10:12.480 --> 10:13.800]  in your previous calculation,
[10:13.800 --> 10:16.200]  you have to square it in the number of times.
[10:16.200 --> 10:18.400]  So we're waiting it by the probability.
[10:20.760 --> 10:23.560]  It's not bad, it was all the formula once.
[10:23.560 --> 10:25.560]  So, how should we do this?
[10:31.160 --> 10:33.000]  I think I can do this.
[10:36.120 --> 10:36.960]  Thanks.
[10:37.840 --> 10:38.680]  Yes.
[10:42.320 --> 10:43.160]  Okay.
[10:46.360 --> 10:49.840]  And the ratio probability is at decimals this time.
[10:49.840 --> 10:52.840]  Just to show you they're interchangeable.
[11:00.160 --> 11:03.640]  Look at the same x and p of x as before.
[11:03.640 --> 11:04.480]  Or this.
[11:06.920 --> 11:08.760]  There, decimals done.
[11:13.320 --> 11:16.240]  So this is the first time we're doing it.
[11:16.240 --> 11:18.040]  Just like you here.
[11:30.400 --> 11:32.440]  So that expectation we just calculated,
[11:32.440 --> 11:34.040]  that is the average.
[11:34.040 --> 11:36.040]  I think I finished it.
[11:36.040 --> 11:41.040]  And then, it's stable to continue for a while.
[11:43.160 --> 11:45.640]  I need to do x minus mu.
[11:45.640 --> 11:48.440]  And then we'll do x minus mu squared.
[11:48.440 --> 11:52.040]  We still like the probability should be interchangeable.
[11:52.040 --> 11:53.800]  We'll do x minus mu.
[12:00.560 --> 12:02.720]  See the whole thing once.
[12:02.720 --> 12:03.960]  I'm not excited.
[12:08.640 --> 12:11.220]  And I'll do it like two seconds.
[12:13.160 --> 12:14.000]  Okay.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  Change your finger, bro.
[12:29.080 --> 12:30.160]  Pens are dead.
[12:31.160 --> 12:33.400]  Note for these first three.
[12:38.960 --> 12:40.880]  We're doing x minus mu.
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.800]  How far away is the boat is from the average.
[12:45.800 --> 12:48.080]  And because we're doing minus and negative number
[12:48.080 --> 12:51.240]  for the first three, we're just adding.
[12:53.040 --> 12:57.200]  And then the last one is minus zero times nine times six.
[12:57.800 --> 13:00.040]  Zero times nine times six.
[13:06.880 --> 13:11.880]  And then things get gross and you gotta square all that.
[13:11.880 --> 13:13.200]  It's scratching.
[13:19.560 --> 13:21.540]  It's still crunchy.
[13:25.540 --> 13:26.840]  But I'll be 60.
[13:27.900 --> 13:29.800]  Things hold good, right?
[13:33.200 --> 13:35.300]  It's completely Chinese.
[13:35.300 --> 13:36.120]  advise you.
[13:36.120 --> 13:43.120]  I'll move the board up a little bit.
[13:43.120 --> 13:48.120]  You can't see it well.
[13:48.120 --> 13:55.120]  I've got it down here, but we can't see it now.
[13:55.120 --> 14:02.120]  I'm going to show you what you're doing.
[14:02.120 --> 14:08.120]  I'm reeling the three S-holes.
[14:08.120 --> 14:11.120]  The problem you see in the quizzes and the tests
[14:11.120 --> 14:13.120]  where you usually tell me about the echo games around the tube,
[14:13.120 --> 14:16.120]  and if they do, then I probably have a good idea
[14:16.120 --> 14:24.120]  to carry one more echo that eats around the echo.
[14:24.120 --> 14:36.120]  Then I need to multiply each of those things back by the echo.
[14:54.120 --> 14:59.120]  That's one of the first four.
[14:59.120 --> 15:04.120]  That might be the other one.
[15:04.120 --> 15:13.120]  So, just to be clear, it's 0.00001.
[15:43.120 --> 16:04.120]  Let me know what I'm going to do.
[16:04.120 --> 16:16.120]  Okay.
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.120]  You can go ahead and put that in the mean, the variance.
[16:20.120 --> 16:23.120]  Then we take the square root, we're going to have to standardize it.
[16:23.120 --> 16:25.120]  It will also be right around 1.
[16:25.120 --> 16:28.120]  It's telling us that a lot of the results within 1,
[16:28.120 --> 16:31.120]  the after, is very close to 0.
[16:31.120 --> 16:35.120]  A lot of the results are 1, 9, and 1, 4.
[16:35.120 --> 16:37.120]  So, that's 3.
[16:37.120 --> 16:40.120]  Let me know if I'm wrong.
[16:40.120 --> 16:41.120]  Okay.
[16:41.120 --> 16:49.120]  I'm going to put this on.
[16:49.120 --> 17:15.120]  Okay.
[17:15.120 --> 17:16.120]  Square root.
[17:45.120 --> 17:56.120]  0.9, 0.4.
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.120]  This is in dollars, in case it wasn't clear.
[18:00.120 --> 18:02.120]  This is in dollars.
[18:02.120 --> 18:13.120]  Mine is 0.0.
[18:13.120 --> 18:16.120]  Yes.
[18:16.120 --> 18:18.120]  Okay.
[18:18.120 --> 18:24.120]  I guess notice that in the formula that we used over there for the variance,
[18:24.120 --> 18:28.120]  we didn't divide by n, like we did a week or two ago.
[18:28.120 --> 18:34.120]  The reason we don't do that is because the probability of X has already taken that into account.
[18:34.120 --> 18:38.120]  So, when you calculate the probability from,
[18:38.120 --> 18:41.120]  you're calculating them from like first principles,
[18:41.120 --> 18:44.120]  then you calculate the actual probability of something happening,
[18:44.120 --> 18:46.120]  you divide by n in there,
[18:46.120 --> 18:50.120]  so the divide by n is already in the event.
[18:50.120 --> 18:53.120]  So, that's why we do that.
[18:53.120 --> 18:58.120]  Okay.
[18:58.120 --> 19:01.120]  Okay.
[19:01.120 --> 19:10.120]  That is it for this part.
[19:10.120 --> 19:17.120]  Let me know if you have a calculator like doing that.
[19:17.120 --> 19:30.120]  I'm going to check on that.
[19:30.120 --> 19:34.120]  No one has any problems.
[19:34.120 --> 19:46.120]  Moving on.
[19:46.120 --> 19:48.120]  Okay.
[19:48.120 --> 20:01.120]  We're heading on to the final one.
[20:01.120 --> 20:06.120]  I've been learning that some of you have learned some of this stuff in high school,
[20:06.120 --> 20:09.120]  which is good.
[20:09.120 --> 20:14.120]  And finally, it's probably one of the things that some of you have seen.
[20:14.120 --> 20:34.120]  What are they?
[20:34.120 --> 20:35.120]  Okay.
[20:35.120 --> 20:40.120]  So, first of all, binomial is a special type of distribution.
[20:40.120 --> 20:44.120]  We're using some of the language from a few weeks ago.
[20:44.120 --> 20:48.120]  It's an experiment that's going to generate outcomes.
[20:48.120 --> 20:53.120]  It has n identical products.
[20:53.120 --> 21:05.120]  There is a probability of success, whatever that means.
[21:05.120 --> 21:11.120]  I'll put success in both.
[21:11.120 --> 21:14.120]  If you get to the final success, it can be bad.
[21:14.120 --> 21:22.120]  It's like the probability of something happening in each trial.
[21:22.120 --> 21:34.120]  Also, probability of failure, which I think can be good.
[21:34.120 --> 21:38.120]  It's not p.
[21:38.120 --> 21:40.120]  It must be 1 minus p.
[21:40.120 --> 21:44.120]  So either you can have a successful trial or a failure in your trial,
[21:44.120 --> 21:47.120]  and you can do it anytime.
[21:47.120 --> 22:09.120]  I'm trying to crack the egg.
[22:09.120 --> 22:32.120]  So each trial has to be used as two binomials.
[22:32.120 --> 22:40.120]  What this means is that flipping a pair of coins,
[22:40.120 --> 22:53.120]  ignoring possible bias in flipping a pair of coins.
[22:53.120 --> 22:55.120]  Uh-oh.
[22:55.120 --> 22:58.120]  Probably not like that.
[22:58.120 --> 23:02.120]  It's p.
[23:02.120 --> 23:08.120]  Flipping a pair of coins, where p is the normal possible bias,
[23:08.120 --> 23:24.120]  when it's okay, is a likelihood of success.
[23:24.120 --> 23:34.120]  Find cards from the top of the deck.
[23:34.120 --> 23:38.120]  I'm saying with that sort of thing, but if you draw a card from the top of the deck
[23:38.120 --> 23:55.120]  and set it aside and draw another one,
[23:55.120 --> 24:10.120]  you can say, with that sort of placement.
[24:10.120 --> 24:13.120]  So drawing one card is fine, but if you keep drawing,
[24:13.120 --> 24:17.120]  it is no longer independent of what you have drawn before,
[24:17.120 --> 24:19.120]  So if you have a deck with ten draws,
[24:19.120 --> 24:34.120]  drawing cards from the top of the deck is not possible.
[24:34.120 --> 24:36.120]  So if you draw one card and look at it,
[24:36.120 --> 24:38.120]  and set aside and draw another card and look at it,
[24:38.120 --> 24:40.120]  and set aside and draw another card and look at it,
[24:40.120 --> 24:41.120]  and set aside and draw another card and look at it,
[24:41.120 --> 24:43.120]  you are not putting any money into the card.
[24:43.120 --> 24:46.120]  So you are drawing a deck with less than a deck,
[24:46.120 --> 24:57.120]  and they are not independent of each other.
[24:57.120 --> 25:00.120]  We'll bring this to one more example.
[25:27.120 --> 25:52.120]  So think about the difference between
[25:52.120 --> 25:54.120]  Let me get going over it again,
[25:54.120 --> 25:57.120]  and drawing a card from the deck.
[25:57.120 --> 26:01.120]  One thing I've said is fine, and one thing I've said is not.
[26:01.120 --> 26:04.120]  What happens if I start calling people randomly,
[26:04.120 --> 26:09.120]  asking them if they support the growing prime minister or something like that?
[26:09.120 --> 26:12.120]  Some people say yes, and some people say no,
[26:12.120 --> 26:15.120]  and I keep calling people randomly.
[26:15.120 --> 26:25.120]  I'm conducting a binomial experiment.
[26:25.120 --> 26:35.120]  It's a trick, because if I don't allow myself to call the same people over and over again,
[26:35.120 --> 26:38.120]  I want to not call the same people.
[26:38.120 --> 26:40.120]  Arguably, you're doing this secondly.
[26:40.120 --> 26:46.120]  You're just drawing from a really big deck of cards that involve people.
[26:46.120 --> 26:55.120]  Technically, because the pool of people that I'm surveying keeps getting a little bit smaller,
[26:55.120 --> 26:57.120]  are you going to make a phone call?
[26:57.120 --> 26:59.120]  It is not like that.
[26:59.120 --> 27:13.120]  The population of people that we survey is so large that we pretend that it's not.
[27:13.120 --> 27:18.120]  This is important because we use this principle to conduct surveys in real life,
[27:18.120 --> 27:22.120]  and determine how people feel about getting in the water too.
[27:43.120 --> 28:03.120]  You can even say something is approximately the same.
[28:03.120 --> 28:08.120]  I believe you might have learned about the distribution that is close to binomial,
[28:08.120 --> 28:13.120]  but actually allows for population size change.
[28:13.120 --> 28:26.120]  But we don't care about that.
[28:26.120 --> 28:31.120]  We are going to use the fact that the population is large,
[28:31.120 --> 28:39.120]  and that we feel more like flipping a coin when we ask someone if they support a candidate or policy or something.
[28:39.120 --> 28:43.120]  Technically, it's not binomial, but we pretend it is.
[29:09.120 --> 29:36.120]  So, we then define X.
[30:06.120 --> 30:34.120]  And choose...
[30:34.120 --> 30:38.120]  That giant C is a giant C.
[30:38.120 --> 30:41.120]  It's choose.
[30:41.120 --> 30:50.120]  And there's a formula for that.
[30:50.120 --> 31:12.120]  So, that's one line C.
[31:12.120 --> 31:34.120]  You may have seen this in high school and early math class.
[31:34.120 --> 31:36.120]  So, N choose X.
[31:36.120 --> 31:39.120]  The number of ways to use X can be chosen from N.
[31:39.120 --> 31:46.120]  So, essentially the number of ways that X is accepted to have a number of...
[31:46.120 --> 32:09.120]  So, that's one way to use X.
[32:09.120 --> 32:11.120]  You have to pop out this.
[32:11.120 --> 32:16.120]  It's basically the same as what's happening there.
[32:16.120 --> 32:19.120]  You read it.
[32:19.120 --> 32:23.120]  No, no, no.
[32:23.120 --> 32:28.120]  No, it's all off.
[32:28.120 --> 32:37.120]  How is it out of it?
[32:37.120 --> 32:42.120]  That's one way to use it.
[32:42.120 --> 32:45.120]  And we'll do it like once today.
[32:45.120 --> 32:48.120]  If the formula is there, there's a table.
[32:48.120 --> 32:51.120]  I will show you that.
[32:51.120 --> 32:55.120]  Example.
[32:55.120 --> 32:57.120]  You know what?
[32:57.120 --> 33:09.120]  Before exam time.
[33:09.120 --> 33:12.120]  Note the expectation.
[33:12.120 --> 33:23.120]  And variance.
[33:23.120 --> 33:29.120]  So, you don't need to manually calculate the mean and variance by coming up with all the X's and the P of X's.
[33:29.120 --> 33:32.120]  With a bit of math.
[33:32.120 --> 33:35.120]  A bit of algebra.
[33:35.120 --> 33:41.120]  You can figure out the average of this integration.
[33:41.120 --> 33:46.120]  The average is N times 10.
[33:46.120 --> 34:03.120]  And this variance is N times 10 times 10.
[34:03.120 --> 34:18.120]  And those formulas might be useful.
[34:18.120 --> 34:23.120]  Think about what you need to do to calculate the average.
[34:23.120 --> 34:26.120]  You need to have all the X's.
[34:26.120 --> 34:29.120]  You need to have the P of X for all of the X's.
[34:29.120 --> 34:33.120]  And then you need to calculate the sum of the fixed series.
[34:33.120 --> 34:37.120]  And then it converges to the N times 10.
[34:37.120 --> 34:43.120]  That's actually a lot of math.
[34:43.120 --> 34:46.120]  So what is the 5th element?
[34:46.120 --> 34:52.120]  The length of the element.
[34:52.120 --> 34:54.120]  Now.
[34:54.120 --> 34:57.120]  What is the 5th element?
[34:57.120 --> 34:59.120]  So that length of the element.
[34:59.120 --> 35:02.120]  You can see the calculator here.
[35:02.120 --> 35:07.120]  So maybe what I'll do is I'll put the example forward and if you're all ready to write you the work on it.
[35:07.120 --> 35:11.120]  Hold on, test.
[35:11.120 --> 35:13.120]  It's a length.
[35:13.120 --> 35:19.120]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[35:19.120 --> 35:22.120]  It's a length.
[35:22.120 --> 35:24.120]  I want nobody in the yard.
[35:24.120 --> 35:27.120]  I want to go to the bathroom.
[35:27.120 --> 35:29.120]  No, it's not the same.
[35:29.120 --> 35:31.120]  You can probably make one but there's some point.
[35:31.120 --> 35:33.120]  It sounds fine.
[35:33.120 --> 35:36.120]  It sounds fine.
[35:36.120 --> 35:51.120]  I can't type for sure either now.
[35:51.120 --> 35:58.120]  I have heard from students and other people that young people are being...
[35:58.120 --> 36:01.120]  Don't worry about it.
[36:01.120 --> 36:07.120]  Not a lot of people lose their jobs but we're also not a lot of people lose their friends.
[36:07.120 --> 36:15.120]  So we're going to suppose that 20% of people thinking of new jobs are unemployed.
[36:15.120 --> 36:18.120]  I'm going to say underemployed.
[36:18.120 --> 36:26.120]  And underemployed meaning that instead of working in whatever field they want to be in and they have a job but it's not what they want.
[36:26.120 --> 36:28.120]  There we go.
[36:28.120 --> 36:42.120]  Survey.
[36:42.120 --> 36:55.120]  What is the probability that...
[36:55.120 --> 37:22.120]  We'll say exactly two equals say they are underemployed.
[37:22.120 --> 37:29.120]  See, two or less people.
[37:29.120 --> 37:45.120]  Then over here, see, four.
[37:45.120 --> 37:47.120]  Okay.
[37:47.120 --> 37:48.120]  I gave you everything you need.
[37:48.120 --> 37:54.120]  I gave you N, I gave you D, I gave you things that I have to give you.
[37:54.120 --> 37:56.120]  Okay, so break time for you in five minutes.
[37:56.120 --> 38:03.120]  If break is done, call my office.
[38:03.120 --> 38:07.120]  If I can't do easy, I can't do shit.
[38:07.120 --> 38:09.120]  I'm not overcomplicating it, bro.
[38:09.120 --> 38:12.120]  No, I'm not.
[38:12.120 --> 38:14.120]  You do it, bro.
[38:14.120 --> 38:16.120]  I have a record account.
[38:16.120 --> 38:20.120]  Just make a lead account, a record account.
[38:20.120 --> 38:22.120]  Plus my thing's still recording, bro.
[38:22.120 --> 38:24.120]  I need to add a pause button after this.
[38:24.120 --> 38:25.120]  Like literally.
[38:25.120 --> 38:27.120]  I got to...
[38:27.120 --> 38:29.120]  Do you have to add the pause button?
[38:29.120 --> 38:30.120]  What?
[38:30.120 --> 38:33.120]  No, it's just representing like the list...
[38:33.120 --> 38:35.120]  Actually the pop method is wrong.
[38:35.120 --> 38:40.120]  What it's representing is like the list length is not changing.
[38:40.120 --> 38:41.120]  So it's a fixed array.
[38:41.120 --> 38:45.120]  Because like Python, the list array size changes, right?
[38:45.120 --> 38:46.120]  You could kind of change as well.
[38:46.120 --> 38:48.120]  You just add things at the end.
[38:48.120 --> 38:49.120]  So that's what it's trying to do.
[38:49.120 --> 38:51.120]  But like I don't know what I'm going to do.
[38:51.120 --> 38:53.120]  So yeah.
[38:53.120 --> 38:54.120]  And now I'm just doing...
[38:54.120 --> 38:55.120]  I'm just making null.
[38:55.120 --> 39:01.120]  And I'm going to shift one over every single time.
[39:01.120 --> 39:05.120]  I don't know if that's a good idea, though.
[39:05.120 --> 39:09.120]  Because like I could just pop out the ones and just like shift everything.
[39:10.120 --> 39:12.120]  It's just going to pop them out, right?
[39:13.120 --> 39:14.120]  Wait.
[39:14.120 --> 39:15.120]  And I guess...
[39:15.120 --> 39:17.120]  Well actually wait, wait, wait.
[39:17.120 --> 39:19.120]  No, no, no, no.
[39:19.120 --> 39:21.120]  Original...
[39:22.120 --> 39:25.120]  And I guess add null to the end, right?
[39:25.120 --> 39:31.120]  Original length is equal to length of num.
[39:31.120 --> 39:32.120]  Right?
[39:32.120 --> 39:38.120]  And I want to just pop out num.popI.
[39:38.120 --> 39:39.120]  Right?
[39:39.120 --> 39:42.120]  Now it's just going to pop out the ones that aren't there, right?
[39:42.120 --> 39:45.120]  And then we're just going to add the end outside of the while loop.
[39:45.120 --> 39:47.120]  We're just going to be like...
[39:51.120 --> 39:52.120]  How do we make this?
[39:52.120 --> 39:53.120]  How do we do this?
[39:53.120 --> 39:54.120]  How do we do this?
[39:55.120 --> 39:56.120]  Actually, you do it.
[39:56.120 --> 39:58.120]  You didn't have to do the whole thing.
[39:58.120 --> 39:59.120]  What?
[39:59.120 --> 40:00.120]  I don't know if you do it.
[40:00.120 --> 40:01.120]  Here you go.
[40:01.120 --> 40:02.120]  I got to beat him.
[40:02.120 --> 40:03.120]  You do it, bro.
[40:03.120 --> 40:04.120]  It's all right.
[40:04.120 --> 40:05.120]  It's all right.
[40:05.120 --> 40:06.120]  Good pepper, bro.
[40:06.120 --> 40:07.120]  Good pepper.
[40:07.120 --> 40:09.120]  You got like receipts on receipts.
[40:09.120 --> 40:12.120]  Only listen to when the professor says shit.
[40:12.120 --> 40:16.120]  I'm telling the AI to listen to when the professor says shit, bro.
[40:16.120 --> 40:18.120]  Because it's going to listen to us right now.
[40:18.120 --> 40:23.120]  But what it does is if I start talking about Python in the middle, it's going to pick up Python and it's going to bring Python shit on here.
[40:23.120 --> 40:24.120]  I'll fill the coin.
[40:24.120 --> 40:25.120]  Head of sales.
[40:37.120 --> 40:52.120]  We cannot compete against like UW kids, bro.

[40:52.120 --> 40:54.120]  I don't know why you're struggling.
[40:54.120 --> 40:55.120]  I'm not struggling.
[40:55.120 --> 40:56.120]  I'm not struggling.
[40:56.120 --> 40:57.120]  I know how to do it, bro.
[40:57.120 --> 40:58.120]  You're thinking too much.
[40:58.120 --> 40:59.120]  I'm not thinking too much.
[40:59.120 --> 41:00.120]  You're thinking too much.
[41:00.120 --> 41:01.120]  No, this is like now I got the answer.
[41:01.120 --> 41:04.120]  I'm straight up here like I don't have the rules.
[41:04.120 --> 41:09.120]  I don't have the rules.
[41:09.120 --> 41:10.120]  You speak for yourself.
[41:10.120 --> 41:12.120]  I'm better than all of this.
[41:12.120 --> 41:33.120]  What?
[41:33.120 --> 41:34.120]  Get up.
[41:34.120 --> 41:38.120]  I remember one thing.
[41:38.120 --> 41:43.120]  CP 164.
[41:43.120 --> 41:45.120]  No, no, no, no, no.
[41:45.120 --> 41:48.120]  I had this one thing with the structures.
[41:48.120 --> 41:49.120]  This is the movie one.
[41:49.120 --> 41:50.120]  Which one was it?
[41:50.120 --> 41:53.120]  We created like an empty list.
[41:53.120 --> 41:54.120]  I want that.
[41:54.120 --> 41:56.120]  What was it?
[41:56.120 --> 42:00.120]  You know you can do it.
[42:01.120 --> 42:02.120]  I know.
[42:02.120 --> 42:05.560]  I'm just trying to figure out something because like he created like I forgot how to make
[42:05.560 --> 42:06.560]  freaking empty lists.
[42:06.560 --> 42:09.120]  That's what the thing is.
[42:09.120 --> 42:12.120]  I remember how to make them but like I kind of forgot.
[42:12.120 --> 42:17.120]  Oh, yeah.
[42:17.120 --> 42:20.120]  So what I want to do is originally.
[42:21.120 --> 42:26.120]  I don't think like.
[42:26.120 --> 42:29.120]  I put the underscores.
[42:29.120 --> 42:31.120]  No, it's but no.
[42:31.120 --> 42:33.120]  But no, then how do you count?
[42:33.120 --> 42:38.120]  It says it doesn't matter what you leave behind the returned kick.
[42:38.120 --> 42:39.120]  Does that mean you don't need the underscores?
[42:39.120 --> 42:41.120]  No, you don't need the underscores.
[42:41.120 --> 42:45.120]  It doesn't leave beyond the kick.
[42:45.120 --> 42:47.120]  No, so like, okay, one, two.
[42:47.120 --> 42:50.120]  What it's doing is like it's a return of length plus one.
[42:50.120 --> 42:51.120]  Right.
[42:51.120 --> 42:52.120]  So one, two.
[42:52.120 --> 42:53.120]  Zero one.
[42:53.120 --> 42:56.120]  It's going to turn two.
[42:56.120 --> 42:59.120]  It's returning the length of the length.
[42:59.120 --> 43:02.120]  Because that's the length.
[43:02.120 --> 43:03.120]  This is like five.
[43:03.120 --> 43:04.120]  So like I could just.
[43:04.120 --> 43:06.120]  Because this length is what?
[43:06.120 --> 43:07.120]  Seven or eight?
[43:07.120 --> 43:09.120]  Why is it returning five then?
[43:09.120 --> 43:10.120]  Where?
[43:10.120 --> 43:11.120]  In the second example.
[43:11.120 --> 43:13.120]  One, two, three, four, five.
[43:13.120 --> 43:14.120]  Yeah.
[43:14.120 --> 43:17.120]  So why are you trying to preserve the original length of this?
[43:17.120 --> 43:18.120]  That's what you were saying you were trying to do.
[43:18.120 --> 43:19.120]  No, I was trying to.
[43:19.120 --> 43:22.120]  What I was trying to do was like I was trying to add the nose at the end.
[43:22.120 --> 43:24.120]  If it's returning the given length.
[43:24.120 --> 43:30.120]  The probability that there are exactly zero.
[43:30.120 --> 43:31.120]  Wait, K?
[43:31.120 --> 43:32.120]  K?
[43:32.120 --> 43:38.120]  There are people who say yes.
[43:38.120 --> 43:41.120]  And thus, and can.
[43:41.120 --> 43:45.120]  Everybody say no.
[43:45.120 --> 43:49.120]  The formula calculates how many waves this could happen.
[43:49.120 --> 43:51.120]  And the probability it could happen.
[43:51.120 --> 43:54.120]  So to get zero people who say yes.
[43:54.120 --> 43:57.120]  Ten people had to say yes.
[43:57.120 --> 43:59.120]  Quite a hard bet.
[43:59.120 --> 44:01.120]  Nobody had to say no.
[44:01.120 --> 44:02.120]  So it's zero.
[44:02.120 --> 44:05.120]  There is exactly one way this could happen.
[44:05.120 --> 44:11.120]  I'm going to try to also do more.
[44:11.120 --> 44:13.120]  I have my pieces.
[44:13.120 --> 44:15.120]  Nobody is going to apply a formula.
[44:15.120 --> 44:19.120]  And this is like one of the main reasons we have to do this.
[44:19.120 --> 44:21.120]  Otherwise, you can't.
[44:21.120 --> 44:24.120]  So the fact that the formula is zero, the fact that the formula is one.
[44:24.120 --> 44:29.120]  You may be like zero times itself is not one.
[44:29.120 --> 44:31.120]  And you are right.
[44:31.120 --> 44:34.120]  The fact oracle is actually a cheating function.
[44:34.120 --> 44:37.120]  That comes from a more complicated function.
[44:37.120 --> 44:41.120]  That actually allows you to take the factorial of any number.
[44:41.120 --> 44:43.120]  Including the decimal.
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.120]  And that function goes through the revamp.
[44:47.120 --> 44:51.120]  So that's why it's called the factorial of the number one.
[44:51.120 --> 44:57.120]  Okay.
[44:57.120 --> 44:59.120]  Also remember that something with power of zero,
[44:59.120 --> 45:04.120]  also one, depends on the number two ones.
[45:04.120 --> 45:07.120]  That is how you do that formula.
[45:07.120 --> 45:09.120]  That was right.
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.120]  That was right.
[45:14.120 --> 45:16.120]  Sorry, the original linear.
[45:16.120 --> 45:18.120]  So I'll use it back in.
[45:18.120 --> 45:20.120]  Next class, I'll show you the tables.
[45:20.120 --> 45:23.120]  I know what I know.
[45:23.120 --> 45:25.120]  Also, I'll show you how to do it in Excel.
[45:25.120 --> 45:39.120]  So, questions?
[45:39.120 --> 45:42.120]  There are shortcuts to doing the early parts of this.
[45:42.120 --> 45:45.120]  Okay, I don't want to figure out what ten factorial is and nine factorial.
[45:45.120 --> 45:48.120]  I just know that this is all numbers from one to nine.
[45:48.120 --> 45:50.120]  It's all numbers from one to ten.
[45:50.120 --> 45:52.120]  And that's one.
[45:52.120 --> 45:57.120]  This is the ten.
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.120]  Times one two.
[45:59.120 --> 46:19.120]  Times whatever plane.
[46:19.120 --> 46:21.120]  Okay, the power now.
[46:21.120 --> 46:39.120]  One three zero.
[46:39.120 --> 46:43.120]  Two six eight.
[46:43.120 --> 46:46.120]  Okay, two six eight.
[46:46.120 --> 46:49.120]  Again, we can kind of walk through it if you like.
[46:49.120 --> 47:00.120]  This is the probability of exactly one yes.
[47:00.120 --> 47:02.120]  Someone has to say yes.
[47:02.120 --> 47:04.120]  Someone has to say no.
[47:04.120 --> 47:27.120]  And there are ten ways this can happen because the end one is an end result.
[47:27.120 --> 47:32.120]  You may be wondering why I'm not answering these questions yet.
[47:32.120 --> 47:39.120]  But that's because I am, once I do the next one, I'm actually going to answer them out of the exact same people.
[47:39.120 --> 47:48.120]  Not only will we have gone through kind of the easier part of this, but we'll also have calculated all the numbers we need to answer all three questions at once.
[47:48.120 --> 48:06.120]  Why?
[48:06.120 --> 48:32.120]  One more time.
[48:32.120 --> 48:35.120]  Notice the formulas kind of pick up.
[48:35.120 --> 48:36.120]  There are like one and two.
[48:36.120 --> 48:39.120]  The formulas don't hang very much.
[48:39.120 --> 48:43.120]  Although they do get more complicated.
[48:43.120 --> 48:48.120]  And you get closer to the middle.
[48:48.120 --> 48:52.120]  So the shortcut here again, it's ten factorial by the eight factorial.
[48:52.120 --> 48:57.120]  So there's nine and ten on the top.
[48:57.120 --> 48:59.120]  Two on the bottom.
[48:59.120 --> 49:07.120]  One.
[49:37.120 --> 49:45.120]  Six.
[49:45.120 --> 49:54.120]  Three.
[49:54.120 --> 50:18.120]  And that is the answer.
[50:18.120 --> 50:40.120]  Exactly.
[50:40.120 --> 50:54.120]  Okay.
[50:54.120 --> 50:59.120]  So that's the last class that we went out of our way to find what a distribution was.
[50:59.120 --> 51:03.120]  It had to have outcome.
[51:03.120 --> 51:15.120]  So, I don't know if it is.
[51:15.120 --> 51:32.120]  I don't need this.
[51:32.120 --> 51:35.120]  I should start reading on that.
[51:35.120 --> 51:48.120]  I should start reading.
[51:48.120 --> 52:15.120]  Okay.
[52:15.120 --> 52:42.120]  Okay.
[52:42.120 --> 52:45.120]  Okay.
[52:45.120 --> 52:52.120]  We have started to build that hit across.
[52:52.120 --> 52:53.120]  Zero.
[52:53.120 --> 52:54.120]  One.
[52:54.120 --> 52:55.120]  Two.
[52:55.120 --> 52:56.120]  Three.
[52:56.120 --> 52:59.120]  One.
[52:59.120 --> 53:01.120]  Of course the answers are hiding all over the place.
[53:01.120 --> 53:06.120]  There's zero.
[53:06.120 --> 53:11.120]  Okay.
[53:11.120 --> 53:15.120]  It was zero.
[53:15.120 --> 53:26.120]  And I had them calculate.
[53:26.120 --> 53:37.120]  And I guess as a answer for you or what's coming, that distribution table I just drew is the table that you give.
[53:37.120 --> 53:40.120]  And you give you a whole bunch of tables.
[53:40.120 --> 53:45.120]  And you go find the end and the thing you want and you do that.
[53:45.120 --> 53:47.120]  So nobody is happier.
[53:47.120 --> 53:51.120]  You don't have to do these calculations if you don't want to.
[53:51.120 --> 54:03.120]  If you're going to use the table, it will be better.
[54:03.120 --> 54:15.120]  This takes a while.
[54:15.120 --> 54:20.120]  Okay.
[54:20.120 --> 54:32.120]  Okay.
[54:32.120 --> 54:37.120]  Okay.
[54:37.120 --> 54:42.120]  Okay.
[54:42.120 --> 54:43.120]  Three.
[54:43.120 --> 54:47.120]  Yeah.
[54:47.120 --> 55:14.120]  So the blue numbers I calculated myself.
[55:14.120 --> 55:17.120]  Okay.
[55:17.120 --> 55:18.120]  Okay.
[55:44.120 --> 55:56.120]  Okay.
[55:56.120 --> 55:58.120]  That's judgment.
[55:58.120 --> 56:04.120]  That's judgment.
[56:04.120 --> 56:09.120]  So that's the average.
[56:09.120 --> 56:27.120]  And also is where the curve.
[56:27.120 --> 56:33.120]  That is my own distribution.
[56:33.120 --> 56:38.120]  Okay.
[56:38.120 --> 56:39.120]  So that was the table.
[56:39.120 --> 56:40.120]  You're in good shape.
[56:40.120 --> 56:43.120]  Next class I will show you a table that I'm not.
[56:43.120 --> 57:06.120]  Okay.
[57:06.120 --> 57:09.120]  Okay.
[57:09.120 --> 57:14.120]  Okay.
[57:14.120 --> 57:38.120]  Okay.
[57:38.120 --> 57:43.120]  Okay.
[57:43.120 --> 57:44.120]  Okay.
[57:44.120 --> 57:45.120]  Okay.
[57:45.120 --> 57:46.120]  Okay.
[57:46.120 --> 57:47.120]  Okay.
[57:47.120 --> 57:48.120]  Okay.
[57:48.120 --> 57:49.120]  So we will be doing the quizzes and the midterm.
[57:49.120 --> 57:51.120]  We will definitely ask you at least one question like this.
[57:51.120 --> 57:53.120]  We always like you to set the questions.
[57:53.120 --> 57:55.120]  Whether it is probability that there will be like two or less successes.
[57:55.120 --> 57:57.120]  Or later more than two.
[57:57.120 --> 58:00.120]  So the probability that there are two or less is two or one or zero.
[58:00.120 --> 58:02.120]  I've kind of written it out in this slightly fancy way.
[58:02.120 --> 58:03.120]  We like to write it out.
[58:33.120 --> 58:58.120]  Okay.
[58:58.120 --> 59:18.120]  Okay.
[59:18.120 --> 59:30.120]  Okay.
[59:30.120 --> 59:46.120]  Thanks.
[59:46.120 --> 01:00:05.120]  Okay.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:27.120]  Okay.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:50.120]  Okay.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:01:13.120]  Okay.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:40.120]  Okay.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:02:07.120]  Okay.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:29.120]  Okay.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:52.120]  Okay.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:03:14.120]  Okay.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:37.120]  Okay.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:04:00.120]  Okay.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:25.120]  Okay.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:40.120]  Okay.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:55.120]  Okay.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:10.120]  Okay.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:25.120]  Okay.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:53.120]  Okay.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:06:15.120]  Okay.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:37.120]  Okay.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:59.120]  Okay.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:21.120]  Okay.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:43.120]  Okay.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:08:05.120]  Okay.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:27.120]  Okay.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:49.120]  Okay.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:09:11.120]  Okay.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:33.120]  Okay.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:55.120]  Okay.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:17.120]  Okay.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:39.120]  Okay.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:11:01.120]  Okay.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:23.120]  Okay.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:45.120]  Okay.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:12:07.120]  Okay.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:29.120]  Okay.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:51.120]  Okay.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:13:13.120]  Okay.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:35.120]  Okay.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.120]  Okay.

[00:00.000 --> 00:02.960]  There will be no lecture on Thursday.
[00:02.960 --> 00:04.960]  This Thursday.
[00:04.960 --> 00:07.800]  You'll have 10 multiple choice questions.
[00:07.800 --> 00:14.520]  And the deadline to submit your answer is October 4 at 10 PM.
[00:14.520 --> 00:22.800]  I will post it on October 2, around 1 PM.
[00:22.800 --> 00:26.800]  So you'll have more than $50,000 to do the exam.
[00:26.800 --> 00:30.440]  The exam can be done in about an hour.
[00:33.280 --> 00:36.320]  And all exam questions will be answered
[00:36.320 --> 00:39.880]  to the ones that we discussed in that lecture.
[00:39.880 --> 00:44.280]  In the final exam, you will have about 20 questions.
[00:44.280 --> 00:47.680]  I didn't decide yet, but there will be around 20 questions.
[00:47.680 --> 00:51.040]  The difference between the written exam and the final exam
[00:51.040 --> 00:52.480]  is that in the final exam, you will
[00:52.480 --> 00:56.560]  have to submit the details of your solutions.
[00:56.600 --> 00:59.720]  But for the midterm exam, it is under quizzes,
[00:59.720 --> 01:03.880]  and you will do it without details
[01:03.880 --> 01:08.000]  for the midterm exam, the first and the second.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.280]  But you have one exam.
[01:10.280 --> 01:14.280]  If you submit the exam, after the deadline, you will get zero.
[01:14.280 --> 01:16.640]  You will look at it after the deadline.
[01:16.640 --> 01:22.760]  Again, you can do it in like half an hour or an hour.
[01:22.760 --> 01:24.040]  Questions about the exam?
[01:26.800 --> 01:30.680]  I will not answer any question about the exam by emails,
[01:30.680 --> 01:33.760]  because the answer has to be to all students.
[01:33.760 --> 01:34.720]  You're OK to tell.
[01:34.720 --> 01:36.120]  No, it's going to be failed.
[01:36.120 --> 01:37.120]  No, no, no.
[01:37.120 --> 01:37.600]  I got it.
[01:37.600 --> 01:41.120]  Any question you want me to answer now?
[01:43.120 --> 01:43.620]  Yes.
[01:46.320 --> 01:47.320]  No, no, I'm sorry, bro.
[01:47.320 --> 01:47.800]  I got you.
[01:50.800 --> 01:52.400]  I got you, bro.
[01:52.400 --> 01:54.480]  What did I say?
[01:54.480 --> 01:56.720]  I said from the lectures, right?
[01:56.720 --> 01:58.520]  Not slides.
[01:58.520 --> 02:01.000]  The slides is not good enough.
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.720]  From the lectures.
[02:02.720 --> 02:07.360]  I was a slide, and I talked about the problem,
[02:07.360 --> 02:09.680]  and I investigated the problem.
[02:09.680 --> 02:12.920]  In the lecture, I went through the assignments.
[02:12.920 --> 02:16.520]  So you need to know what has been done in the lecture.
[02:16.520 --> 02:23.320]  If you miss a lecture, then read it from the text book.
[02:23.320 --> 02:29.520]  If you miss chapter two, read chapter two from the textbook.
[02:29.520 --> 02:31.480]  OK?
[02:31.480 --> 02:34.040]  Well, the questions will be similar to the ones
[02:34.040 --> 02:36.880]  that we discussed in the class.
[02:36.880 --> 02:43.040]  There will be no questions that you have seen for the first time.
[02:43.040 --> 02:44.320]  No.
[02:44.320 --> 02:46.000]  This is a basic course.
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.680]  So all questions must be discussed in the lecture.
[02:51.680 --> 02:52.920]  All of them.
[02:52.920 --> 02:55.360]  All of the final exam questions.
[02:55.360 --> 02:59.000]  All the two midterm and exam questions.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  No, thanks for the statement.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.040]  Yes?
[03:03.040 --> 03:04.600]  Questions?
[03:04.600 --> 03:06.840]  More questions?
[03:06.840 --> 03:09.640]  To make sure you see here, the exam questions
[03:09.640 --> 03:17.760]  are similar to the ones that we discussed in the lecture.
[03:17.760 --> 03:19.760]  This is in my hand in this space.
[03:19.760 --> 03:22.880]  And you will find the midterm exam under the courses
[03:22.880 --> 03:27.520]  the same way that you solved it, assignment one or two or three.
[03:27.520 --> 03:28.020]  OK?
[03:31.520 --> 03:33.120]  Good.
[03:33.120 --> 03:38.840]  What we are going to do today is chapter four.
[03:38.840 --> 03:44.400]  We went through chapter four, and we came last time with 12 rules.
[03:49.760 --> 03:52.200]  These 12 rules.
[03:52.200 --> 03:54.200]  So we need to know these 12 rules.
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.200]  We wrote them last time.
[03:59.200 --> 04:03.680]  And these rules can be used to simplify an expression.
[04:09.680 --> 04:11.680]  Divergence here.
[04:11.680 --> 04:15.680]  We wrote the divergence here.
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.600]  And I want to remind you that when you see rules,
[04:22.600 --> 04:24.600]  you remember two statements.
[04:24.600 --> 04:25.100]  Why?
[04:25.100 --> 04:29.600]  The two statements will be the easiest way to prove.
[04:29.600 --> 04:34.600]  And the two statements, if I have two variables,
[04:34.600 --> 04:36.080]  then you will have four rows.
[04:36.080 --> 04:39.480]  So this is blue.
[04:39.480 --> 04:47.480]  That's x, y bar equal x bar plus y bar.
[04:47.480 --> 04:48.480]  How to memorize it?
[04:48.480 --> 04:55.480]  You distribute the bars and you change multiplication into summation plus.
[04:58.480 --> 05:03.480]  Or you change the plus into multiplication.
[05:03.880 --> 05:08.880]  And also distribute the bar.
[05:08.880 --> 05:11.880]  This is how to do it.
[05:11.880 --> 05:14.880]  How to do it?
[05:14.880 --> 05:19.880]  This way is to stay with all possible values.
[05:19.880 --> 05:26.880]  And then you find that x, y bar is the same as x bar plus y bar.
[05:27.280 --> 05:34.280]  x plus y bar is the same as x bar y bar.
[05:34.280 --> 05:39.280]  Here is the divergence here.
[05:39.280 --> 05:44.280]  But I don't want you to memorize this rule.
[05:44.280 --> 05:46.280]  What is this rule?
[05:46.280 --> 05:53.280]  It shows that x, y, z bar can be very easy to memorize.
[05:57.280 --> 05:58.280]  Yeah.
[06:03.280 --> 06:06.280]  Can we prove that it is not equal?
[06:06.280 --> 06:13.280]  It's not equal to x plus y plus z bar.
[06:13.280 --> 06:14.280]  How?
[06:14.280 --> 06:17.280]  How we can prove that it is not equal?
[06:17.280 --> 06:22.280]  If you use the truth table, you will have eight rows.
[06:22.280 --> 06:25.280]  And then you can prove that it is not equal.
[06:25.680 --> 06:34.680]  So, x, y, z bar, x, y, z bar equal.
[06:34.680 --> 06:39.680]  You distribute the bar, change the bar into plus.
[06:39.680 --> 06:44.680]  Then it is equal to x bar plus y bar plus z bar.
[06:44.680 --> 06:47.680]  This is different.
[06:47.680 --> 06:50.680]  What about x plus y plus z bar?
[06:50.680 --> 06:55.680]  x bar is equal to x bar y bar z bar.
[06:55.680 --> 06:56.680]  Questions?
[06:56.680 --> 06:59.680]  Any questions?
[07:02.680 --> 07:05.680]  So again, how can you prove this one?
[07:05.680 --> 07:08.680]  You can use the theorem or you can use the question.
[07:08.680 --> 07:10.680]  I can just appreciate it.
[07:10.680 --> 07:12.680]  What about this one?
[07:12.680 --> 07:17.680]  Distribute the bar, change multiplication into plus.
[07:17.680 --> 07:19.680]  What about this one?
[07:20.680 --> 07:24.680]  Distribute the bar, change the plus into multiplication.
[07:28.680 --> 07:33.680]  You can have other values here.
[07:33.680 --> 07:36.680]  Right?
[07:38.680 --> 07:40.680]  Distribute the bar.
[07:40.680 --> 07:43.680]  Distribute the one in this case.
[07:43.680 --> 07:47.680]  A plus B plus C bar.
[07:47.680 --> 07:49.680]  This is multiplication here.
[07:49.680 --> 07:51.680]  Then you will get plus B bar.
[07:51.680 --> 07:54.680]  And then you apply the rule again.
[07:56.680 --> 08:03.680]  To avoid doing mistake, you can make it A plus B plus C as like x.
[08:06.680 --> 08:09.680]  But you don't have to.
[08:10.680 --> 08:13.680]  You can do it one step.
[08:13.680 --> 08:19.680]  So the other step is A plus B plus C bar equal
[08:22.680 --> 08:25.680]  change the plus into multiplication.
[08:25.680 --> 08:27.680]  Distribute the bar.
[08:27.680 --> 08:30.680]  Questions?
[08:34.680 --> 08:36.680]  Okay.
[08:36.680 --> 08:39.680]  More examples.
[08:39.680 --> 08:44.680]  Now, we will start the real stuff.
[08:44.680 --> 08:47.680]  This is AND gate.
[08:47.680 --> 08:50.680]  Then what is the output of the AND gate?
[08:50.680 --> 08:52.680]  CD.
[08:52.680 --> 08:57.680]  So here will be B or CD.
[08:59.680 --> 09:02.680]  You can also write CD or B.
[09:02.680 --> 09:05.680]  Again, when I say or, this is the plus.
[09:05.680 --> 09:07.680]  B plus CD.
[09:07.680 --> 09:09.680]  This is the more than expression.
[09:09.680 --> 09:16.680]  So the final output is A times B plus CD.
[09:16.680 --> 09:23.680]  What kind of questions can I ask you in the final exam, second middle exam?
[09:23.680 --> 09:26.680]  I gave you a circuit.
[09:26.680 --> 09:29.680]  And I asked you what is the output.
[09:29.680 --> 09:32.680]  And then I gave you four possible answers.
[09:32.680 --> 09:34.680]  Or five.
[09:34.680 --> 09:37.680]  One of them is correct.
[09:37.680 --> 09:41.680]  Is AB plus ACD correct?
[09:42.680 --> 09:44.680]  Yes, correct.
[09:44.680 --> 09:50.680]  AB plus ACD is also correct.
[09:51.680 --> 09:54.680]  Questions?
[09:54.680 --> 10:03.680]  I heard the version of the same question.
[10:03.680 --> 10:05.680]  Yes.
[10:05.680 --> 10:08.680]  I gave you this gate C, B, B.
[10:08.680 --> 10:12.680]  And I gave you this gate A.
[10:12.680 --> 10:15.680]  And I gave you the answer.
[10:15.680 --> 10:17.680]  I write this gate.
[10:17.680 --> 10:21.680]  And I say, what is this gate?
[10:22.680 --> 10:26.680]  So this will be a harder version of the same question.
[10:26.680 --> 10:31.680]  And back to your friend when he asked me what is in the exam.
[10:31.680 --> 10:36.680]  In the exam will be questions from the lecture.
[10:36.680 --> 10:38.680]  Did I talk about this?
[10:38.680 --> 10:40.680]  Yes.
[10:40.680 --> 10:49.680]  Did I mention that I can either, I gave it and I gave you the output and the input.
[10:49.680 --> 10:51.680]  And these two gates.
[10:51.680 --> 10:53.680]  And then I ask you what is this gate?
[10:53.680 --> 10:55.680]  Yes.
[10:55.680 --> 11:05.680]  Can I, in my answer, I will say, is this gate N, XOR, NOR, OR?
[11:05.680 --> 11:07.680]  And then the right answer is?
[11:07.680 --> 11:09.680]  OR.
[11:09.680 --> 11:14.680]  And in your solution, in your VMA, you try to show as much details as possible.
[11:14.680 --> 11:17.680]  And then you select the right answer.
[11:17.680 --> 11:25.680]  And in the final exam, the first page will summarize all your detailed answers.
[11:25.680 --> 11:30.680]  So if you selected B in question one, then in question one you write A.
[11:30.680 --> 11:32.680]  In question two you write B.
[11:32.680 --> 11:39.680]  So the first page summary of your 20 questions in the final exam.
[11:39.680 --> 11:43.680]  In the midterm exam, you don't need to submit the details.
[11:43.680 --> 11:46.680]  You just select an answer.
[11:46.680 --> 11:49.680]  But you have one attempt.
[11:49.680 --> 11:53.680]  You have 48 hours to do it.
[11:53.680 --> 12:01.680]  In the final exam, you have 2.5 hours in an exam that I will make sure you can solve it in one hour.
[12:01.680 --> 12:04.680]  But you have to relax, no time pressure.
[12:04.680 --> 12:08.680]  You have enough time to review your answer.
[12:08.680 --> 12:13.680]  I will be there, in the final exam.
[12:13.680 --> 12:15.680]  Most probably I will go.
[12:15.680 --> 12:18.680]  But I will not answer any question.
[12:18.680 --> 12:22.680]  Because I cannot tell you what is the answer.
[12:22.680 --> 12:25.680]  I cannot explain what is this old gate for.
[12:25.680 --> 12:29.680]  Some students actually say, what is this old gate for?
[12:29.680 --> 12:32.680]  I don't know.
[12:32.680 --> 12:34.680]  What can I tell you?
[12:34.680 --> 12:35.680]  Okay?
[12:35.680 --> 12:39.680]  So all questions will be from the lectures.
[12:39.680 --> 12:44.680]  And I will try my best to go through all the assignment questions.
[12:44.680 --> 12:47.680]  I want to solve the first three chapters.
[12:47.680 --> 12:49.680]  The first three assignments.
[12:49.680 --> 12:53.680]  I will try my best to go through all of them.
[12:53.680 --> 12:57.680]  Today I am intending to finish this chapter.
[12:57.680 --> 13:01.680]  Depending on you, I will see how long I will take to finish it.
[13:01.680 --> 13:04.680]  And after I finish it, that's it.
[13:04.680 --> 13:06.680]  For chapter four.
[13:06.680 --> 13:08.680]  So you will relax.
[13:08.680 --> 13:13.680]  And you will get ready for the retelling.
[13:13.680 --> 13:15.680]  Question.
[13:15.680 --> 13:19.680]  Ask me a question.
[13:19.680 --> 13:24.680]  I didn't want you to come.
[13:24.680 --> 13:27.680]  Chapter four.
[13:27.680 --> 13:31.680]  Like if I say it's not going to be in the exam, you will not study it.
[13:31.680 --> 13:34.680]  And it's bad, bad, bad.
[13:34.680 --> 13:40.680]  And if I say chapter four will be in the dependent exam, it is not going to be in the dependent exam.
[13:40.680 --> 13:45.680]  So I ask you to study up to this chapter.
[13:45.680 --> 13:49.680]  And you can see that the materials are related.
[13:49.680 --> 13:53.680]  But to answer your question in a better way.
[13:53.680 --> 14:01.680]  And if I say verification of women's ex-separation is not going to be in the final exam.
[14:01.680 --> 14:05.680]  It is not going to be in the final exam.
[14:05.680 --> 14:08.680]  Definitely it's going to be in the final exam.
[14:08.680 --> 14:12.680]  Chapter four definitely is going to be very important.
[14:12.680 --> 14:15.680]  It's going to be in the final exam.
[14:15.680 --> 14:19.680]  For example, I am going to talk about Khan of Ma.
[14:19.680 --> 14:21.680]  It's not going to be in the midterm exam.
[14:21.680 --> 14:23.680]  This midterm exam.
[14:23.680 --> 14:25.680]  I'm going to do about it today.
[14:25.680 --> 14:26.680]  Okay.
[14:26.680 --> 14:28.680]  Does this answer your question?
[14:28.680 --> 14:31.680]  What is your question?
[14:31.680 --> 14:33.680]  Chapter four.
[14:33.680 --> 14:34.680]  Other chapters.
[14:34.680 --> 14:36.680]  Chapter five.
[14:36.680 --> 14:38.680]  How do you use the end-to-end class?
[14:38.680 --> 14:41.680]  Yeah.
[14:41.680 --> 14:44.680]  All chapters will be in the end-to-end class.
[14:44.680 --> 14:45.680]  Chapter one.
[14:45.680 --> 14:48.680]  We talked about everything in chapter one, right?
[14:48.680 --> 14:57.680]  Just I told the world is here in chapter one and then chapter two.
[14:57.680 --> 14:59.680]  And then this chapter.
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.680]  You can see how things are related to each other.
[15:04.680 --> 15:06.680]  Okay.
[15:06.680 --> 15:10.680]  Now, what about the truth table?
[15:10.680 --> 15:12.680]  How do you write the truth table?
[15:12.680 --> 15:17.680]  If I go 0, 0, 0, 0, this would be 0, right?
[15:17.680 --> 15:19.680]  This would be 0, right?
[15:19.680 --> 15:22.160]  0 and 0 is 0.
[15:22.160 --> 15:26.160]  Then what is the final output?
[15:26.160 --> 15:27.660]  0.
[15:27.660 --> 15:29.160]  I will have 0.
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.680]  And then I will want 1 for D. And then I will want
[15:33.680 --> 15:35.920]  how many possible rows?
[15:35.920 --> 15:37.880]  16.
[15:37.880 --> 15:41.480]  And then I will calculate what is the output.
[15:41.480 --> 15:44.360]  This is the truth table.
[15:44.360 --> 15:50.640]  But I can also, instead of putting them here and calculate the output,
[15:50.640 --> 15:53.240]  I can calculate the output from this expression.
[15:53.240 --> 15:55.560]  Because I already calculated this expression.
[15:55.560 --> 16:01.200]  So can I put 0, 0 plus 0, 0 equal 0.
[16:01.200 --> 16:05.160]  And if I go to the second one, D is equal to 1.
[16:05.160 --> 16:11.320]  1 times 0 plus, so 0, 0 plus 0, 0, 0, the output is 0.
[16:11.320 --> 16:16.120]  Then I can use the expression and change the values.
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.280]  Now, if D is 1, 1, 1, 1.
[16:20.280 --> 16:26.200]  Obviously, the output is 1 plus 1 times 1 is 1.
[16:26.200 --> 16:29.600]  And then I come with the truth table.
[16:29.600 --> 16:36.920]  You have to know how to go from the expression to the truth table.
[16:36.920 --> 16:41.200]  This is very important.
[16:41.200 --> 16:47.400]  In my previous exams, always there's a question about the truth table.
[16:47.400 --> 16:53.040]  Because the exam will cover all chapters, but also in a way
[16:53.040 --> 16:58.520]  such that we went through it in the lecture.
[16:58.520 --> 17:00.160]  What about this question?
[17:00.160 --> 17:01.800]  What do I have here?
[17:01.800 --> 17:06.280]  I have here D, A, this is A, B.
[17:06.280 --> 17:07.120]  What about this?
[17:07.120 --> 17:15.400]  A times A times B plus C. A times B plus C.
[17:15.400 --> 17:17.000]  What about this one?
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.880]  B plus C, right?
[17:20.880 --> 17:32.040]  B plus C and B. B plus C and B.
[17:32.080 --> 17:37.880]  So these gates give me this expression.
[17:37.880 --> 17:43.640]  But if I use now when I use simplification,
[17:43.640 --> 17:53.280]  when I simplify this expression, I have here A, B plus A, B plus A, C.
[17:53.280 --> 18:02.000]  Plus B, B plus B, C. If I simplify this expression,
[18:02.760 --> 18:06.440]  I will get only two gates.
[18:06.440 --> 18:11.760]  I will get B plus A, C. Details.
[18:11.760 --> 18:14.080]  Details about this.
[18:14.080 --> 18:27.600]  A, B plus A, B plus A, C plus B, B plus B, C. A, B plus A, B plus A, C plus B, B plus B, C.
[18:27.640 --> 18:33.040]  Now, what is B, B?
[18:33.040 --> 18:35.320]  It's just a B?
[18:35.320 --> 18:39.400]  What is A, B plus A, B?
[18:39.400 --> 18:40.920]  Only A, B, right?
[18:40.920 --> 18:43.080]  One A, B?
[18:43.080 --> 18:44.440]  Leave me some students.
[18:44.440 --> 18:46.000]  They will write in the final exam.
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.400]  Two A, B. There is no two.
[18:49.400 --> 18:50.240]  There is no two.
[18:50.240 --> 18:51.800]  It's only a suggestion.
[18:51.800 --> 18:55.920]  A, B. Two A, B plus two.
[18:55.920 --> 18:56.400]  OK.
[18:56.400 --> 19:02.480]  So you can see here, I use A, B plus A, B to get A, B.
[19:02.480 --> 19:09.680]  I can have B as a common factor, so it is one plus C. One plus C is one, so it is B.
[19:09.680 --> 19:23.200]  And I have here the rule that is A, B plus B is A plus one times B.
[19:23.200 --> 19:33.880]  So it is B times A plus one is B times one is B.
[19:33.880 --> 19:39.120]  So the final expression is B plus C.
[19:39.120 --> 19:41.600]  Question.
[19:41.600 --> 19:51.480]  I was able to simplify this long one to get B plus A, C by using these rules.
[19:51.480 --> 19:56.800]  Do you need to memorize the rule number?
[19:56.800 --> 19:59.880]  Rule number seven says B, B, B, B.
[19:59.880 --> 20:03.360]  No, you don't need to memorize the rule number.
[20:03.360 --> 20:05.760]  But you need to memorize the rule.
[20:05.760 --> 20:11.600]  You need to know that B, B, equal B. What is the rule number?
[20:11.600 --> 20:12.520]  Who cares?
[20:12.520 --> 20:15.160]  Number seven, number nine.
[20:15.160 --> 20:20.280]  But you need to show that there is a rule B, B, B, equal B.
[20:20.280 --> 20:21.760]  Okay.
[20:21.760 --> 20:24.440]  Another question.
[20:24.440 --> 20:30.720]  Is this the only way to prove that B plus A, C is equal to A, B plus A, B plus A, C
[20:30.720 --> 20:33.520]  plus B, B plus B, C?
[20:33.520 --> 20:37.280]  The answer is no.
[20:37.280 --> 20:42.760]  You may do the rules in a different order, and you may use different rules, but at the
[20:42.760 --> 20:47.200]  end, you need to come with the same answer.
[20:47.280 --> 20:54.280]  But whatever will come to your mind and you ought to apply, apply until you get the final
[20:54.280 --> 20:56.280]  simplification.
[20:56.280 --> 21:02.040]  We will learn today that there is something called the K-Map that can do the simplification
[21:02.040 --> 21:04.800]  much faster.
[21:04.800 --> 21:06.160]  Much faster.
[21:06.160 --> 21:10.760]  So using K-Map is also another idea.
[21:10.760 --> 21:14.240]  Questions.
[21:14.280 --> 21:18.720]  Do you have any questions about the first midterm exam?
[21:18.720 --> 21:25.280]  Because as I said before, I posted enough information in my learning space, and the
[21:25.280 --> 21:31.640]  only time that I will answer questions about midterm exam is during the lecture.
[21:31.640 --> 21:33.120]  Question answered.
[21:33.120 --> 21:39.200]  Or if it is a very important question, then I will post it in my learning space for all
[21:39.200 --> 21:41.440]  the students.
[21:41.440 --> 21:43.440]  Okay.
[21:44.960 --> 21:46.960]  Okay.
[21:46.960 --> 21:55.200]  So we learned Boolean Algebra, rules, and there are other problems.
[21:55.200 --> 21:59.200]  You can go through them.
[21:59.200 --> 22:05.840]  And now you understand that if I have some gates connected together, like here, I have
[22:05.840 --> 22:10.240]  gate and, and, and, then what is the output here?
[22:10.240 --> 22:11.440]  A, B.
[22:11.440 --> 22:12.480]  What about here?
[22:12.480 --> 22:13.920]  B, C, D.
[22:13.920 --> 22:15.120]  What about here?
[22:15.120 --> 22:16.320]  A, C.
[22:16.320 --> 22:21.120]  Then the output is A, D plus B, C, D plus A, C.
[22:24.320 --> 22:32.320]  You can see the materials are easy, but you have to be very careful when you select an
[22:32.320 --> 22:35.120]  answer and amount of choice questions.
[22:37.920 --> 22:40.720]  This is harder.
[22:40.720 --> 22:42.320]  What is this?
[22:42.320 --> 22:49.920]  I have here a random gate, and random gate, and random gate, and I have here, oh, here
[22:49.920 --> 22:56.320]  it was, before the old gate, there are negative, so this is called a negative or, if you like
[22:56.320 --> 22:58.320]  to call it.
[22:58.320 --> 23:05.920]  Is this gate and this gate, these gates, the acceleration one, are the same?
[23:05.920 --> 23:08.720]  Yes, of course, this is the same.
[23:08.720 --> 23:14.720]  This not cancel this not, this not cancel this not, this not cancel this not, right?
[23:14.720 --> 23:19.920]  But what is the advantage of knowing this here?
[23:19.920 --> 23:31.120]  The advantage is, if I give you acceleration and I ask you to use only NAND gates to design
[23:31.120 --> 23:32.720]  the circuit.
[23:32.720 --> 23:37.520]  So the first step is use AND OR gate.
[23:37.520 --> 23:39.920]  Use AND OR gate.
[23:39.920 --> 23:41.920]  This is easy.
[23:41.920 --> 23:47.920]  And then when you put inverters, both then, in pairs, so they will cancel each other.
[23:47.920 --> 23:54.720]  So I did here, both inverter and inverter, inverter and inverter, inverter and inverter.
[23:54.720 --> 23:59.120]  This not gate will make this land, land, land.
[23:59.120 --> 24:02.320]  What about this OR?
[24:02.320 --> 24:10.720]  OR, but it is before it, there is not, not, not, then the whole thing will be, so this
[24:10.720 --> 24:11.920]  will be that.
[24:11.920 --> 24:18.720]  Then I was able to design the circuit using OR NAND gates.
[24:18.720 --> 24:22.720]  OR NAND gates.
[24:22.720 --> 24:35.520]  Now I want to talk about something very important.
[24:35.520 --> 24:48.320]  Very simple, very easy, but many students do mistakes on the sender side.
[24:48.320 --> 24:51.520]  What is sum of product?
[24:51.520 --> 24:57.520]  So you see, sum, sum, of product.
[24:57.520 --> 25:03.520]  This is sum of product.
[25:03.520 --> 25:31.520]  What about if I have say F equal A B plus A C plus B C?
[25:31.520 --> 25:39.520]  This is sum, sum of product.
[25:39.520 --> 25:45.520]  This is called sum of product.
[25:45.520 --> 25:51.520]  Then what is standard sum of product?
[25:51.520 --> 25:53.520]  So I talked about sum of product.
[25:53.520 --> 25:55.520]  I have no problem with sum of product.
[25:55.520 --> 26:01.520]  Now I want to talk about standard sum of product.
[26:01.520 --> 26:09.520]  Standard sum of product I have to have, here I have three variables, A, B, C, then I have
[26:09.520 --> 26:13.520]  to have A, B, C, A, B, C in all terms.
[26:13.520 --> 26:15.520]  How are you do that?
[26:15.520 --> 26:21.520]  A, B, I, C plus C bar.
[26:21.520 --> 26:25.520]  What is C plus C bar?
[26:25.520 --> 26:27.520]  If this is zero, this is one.
[26:27.520 --> 26:29.520]  If this is one, this is zero.
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.520]  Then C plus C bar equal one.
[26:33.520 --> 26:35.520]  You have to realize the rules.
[26:35.520 --> 26:37.520]  We talked about the 12 rules.
[26:37.520 --> 26:39.520]  You want to choose them in details.
[26:39.520 --> 26:43.520]  Plus, what is missing here?
[26:43.520 --> 26:49.520]  B, then I will multiply by B plus B bar.
[26:49.520 --> 26:51.520]  What is missing here?
[26:51.520 --> 26:59.520]  A, then I will multiply by A plus A bar because this is one.
[26:59.520 --> 27:17.520]  Then this will be A, B, C plus A, B, C bar plus A, C, B plus A, C, B, bar.
[27:19.520 --> 27:27.520]  Plus A, B, C plus A bar, B, C.
[27:27.520 --> 27:31.520]  Now, I have A, B, C, I have A, B, C, I have A, B, C.
[27:31.520 --> 27:35.520]  I will, this is equal to plus A, B, C.
[27:35.520 --> 27:37.520]  A, B, C bar.
[27:37.520 --> 27:41.520]  A, B, C bar.
[27:41.520 --> 27:47.520]  Plus A, C, B bar.
[27:47.520 --> 27:51.520]  Plus A bar, B, C.
[27:51.520 --> 27:53.520]  I want to arrange them.
[27:53.520 --> 28:05.520]  So I will have A, B, C plus A, B, C bar plus A, B bar, C plus A bar, C bar.
[28:05.520 --> 28:15.520]  So I will have A, B, C, B bar, C plus A bar, B, C.
[28:15.520 --> 28:17.520]  This is called sum of product.
[28:17.520 --> 28:25.520]  This is called the standard sum of product.
[28:25.520 --> 28:31.520]  Now, true statement will show that this is ABC.
[28:31.520 --> 28:35.520]  This is F, 0, 0, 0.
[28:35.520 --> 28:37.520]  What is the output?
[28:37.520 --> 28:55.520]  If this is 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 is 0, right?
[29:01.520 --> 29:13.520]  And I will continue finding the expression and work the buttons.
[29:13.520 --> 29:19.520]  And I can do this in a table.
[29:19.520 --> 29:23.520]  In a table but in different orders.
[29:23.520 --> 29:27.520]  And this is called carbon of map.
[29:27.520 --> 29:33.520]  For carbon of map, I have here three variables.
[29:33.520 --> 29:37.520]  So I will have A, B, C.
[29:37.520 --> 29:39.520]  And A can be 0, 1.
[29:39.520 --> 29:43.520]  B, C can be 0, 0, 0, 1.
[29:43.520 --> 29:45.520]  Can be 1, 1.
[29:45.520 --> 29:47.520]  I will write 1, 1 first.
[29:47.520 --> 29:51.520]  I didn't write 0, 1.
[29:51.520 --> 29:55.520]  Why? Because I want to make one bit change.
[29:55.520 --> 29:57.520]  I want to change one bit.
[29:57.520 --> 30:01.520]  So this is why I wrote them in this order.
[30:01.520 --> 30:05.520]  Why I want to work one bit change?
[30:05.520 --> 30:09.520]  Because I want to move them to the 75th acceleration.
[30:09.520 --> 30:13.520]  And I will talk about this in more details soon.
[30:13.520 --> 30:15.520]  Good.
[30:15.520 --> 30:21.520]  So I am going to work the values here.
[30:21.520 --> 30:23.520]  Okay, from the two tables.
[30:23.520 --> 30:25.520]  But let me continue the two tables.
[30:25.520 --> 30:27.520]  0, 0, 1.
[30:27.520 --> 30:29.520]  This is 0.
[30:29.520 --> 30:31.520]  This is 0.
[30:31.520 --> 30:33.520]  This is 0.
[30:33.520 --> 30:35.520]  I have 1 here.
[30:35.520 --> 30:37.520]  0, then I have 0.
[30:37.520 --> 30:39.520]  0, 1, 0.
[30:39.520 --> 30:41.520]  This is 0.
[30:41.520 --> 30:43.520]  Now this is 0.
[30:43.520 --> 30:49.520]  And 1.
[30:49.520 --> 30:53.520]  We have here 0, then this is 0.
[30:53.520 --> 30:55.520]  1, 1, 0.
[30:55.520 --> 30:57.520]  This is 0.
[30:57.520 --> 30:59.520]  This is 0.
[30:59.520 --> 31:01.520]  This is 0.
[31:01.520 --> 31:05.520]  So obviously when here is 0, this term is 0.
[31:05.520 --> 31:07.520]  So I have to be sure about this one.
[31:07.520 --> 31:09.520]  Which is 1.
[31:09.520 --> 31:13.520]  What about 0, 0, but here is 1?
[31:13.520 --> 31:15.520]  This is 0, this is 0, this is 0.
[31:15.520 --> 31:23.520]  But when I have 0, so this is 0, then obviously this will be 0.
[31:23.520 --> 31:25.520]  What about 1, 0, 1?
[31:25.520 --> 31:27.520]  1, 0, 1 is 1.
[31:27.520 --> 31:29.520]  Because this will be 1.
[31:29.520 --> 31:31.520]  What about 0, 1, 1?
[31:31.520 --> 31:33.520]  0, 1, 1.
[31:33.520 --> 31:35.520]  1.
[31:35.520 --> 31:37.520]  What about 1, 1, 1?
[31:37.520 --> 31:39.520]  1, 1, 1.
[31:39.520 --> 31:41.520]  1, 1, 1.
[31:41.520 --> 31:43.520]  1, 1, 1.
[31:43.520 --> 31:45.520]  1, 1, 1.
[31:45.520 --> 31:47.520]  1.
[31:47.520 --> 31:49.520]  I come here to what I call the carbon tax.
[31:49.520 --> 31:53.520]  Which is the same as the boost table, but I
[31:53.520 --> 31:57.520]  both of them such that there is one basic change.
[31:57.520 --> 31:59.520]  So I have here 0.
[31:59.520 --> 32:01.520]  0.
[32:01.520 --> 32:03.520]  A equals 0, B, C.
[32:03.520 --> 32:05.520]  The value is
[32:05.520 --> 32:07.520]  0.
[32:07.520 --> 32:11.520]  And when I have 0,
[32:11.520 --> 32:13.520]  1, 1.
[32:13.520 --> 32:15.520]  So 0, sorry.
[32:15.520 --> 32:19.520]  Now, this is a new order.
[32:19.520 --> 32:23.520]  So I have 0, 1, 1 is 1.
[32:23.520 --> 32:27.520]  0, 1, 0 is 0.
[32:27.520 --> 32:29.520]  1, 0, 1.
[32:29.520 --> 32:31.520]  So P is 1.
[32:31.520 --> 32:35.520]  Cursed 1, 0, 0.
[32:35.520 --> 32:37.520]  1, 0, 1, 0.
[32:37.520 --> 32:39.520]  1, 0, 1, 0.
[32:39.520 --> 32:41.520]  1, 0, 1.
[32:41.520 --> 32:45.520]  1, 1, 1, 0.
[32:45.520 --> 32:47.520]  1, 1, 0.
[32:47.520 --> 32:49.520]  What is the value?
[32:49.520 --> 32:51.520]  1.
[32:51.520 --> 32:53.520]  What is the value?
[32:53.520 --> 32:55.520]  1.
[32:55.520 --> 32:57.520]  Now,
[32:57.520 --> 32:59.520]  I talked about
[32:59.520 --> 33:01.520]  sum of product.
[33:01.520 --> 33:03.520]  Sum of product.
[33:03.520 --> 33:05.520]  I talked about standard
[33:05.520 --> 33:07.520]  sum of products.
[33:07.520 --> 33:09.520]  But what is the minimum
[33:09.520 --> 33:11.520]  sum of product?
[33:11.520 --> 33:13.520]  The minimum sum of product
[33:13.520 --> 33:15.520]  I have to use
[33:15.520 --> 33:17.520]  my
[33:17.520 --> 33:19.520]  knowledge
[33:19.520 --> 33:21.520]  and use kind of math
[33:21.520 --> 33:23.520]  to combine these two
[33:23.520 --> 33:25.520]  and combine these two and I combine
[33:25.520 --> 33:27.520]  these two. So if I combine
[33:27.520 --> 33:29.520]  these two, A is 1
[33:29.520 --> 33:31.520]  and C is
[33:31.520 --> 33:33.520]  1.
[33:33.520 --> 33:35.520]  So F equals
[33:35.520 --> 33:37.520]  these two, A
[33:37.520 --> 33:39.520]  C.
[33:39.520 --> 33:41.520]  Plus these two,
[33:41.520 --> 33:43.520]  B,
[33:43.520 --> 33:45.520]  C.
[33:45.520 --> 33:47.520]  Plus these two,
[33:47.520 --> 33:49.520]  A,
[33:49.520 --> 33:51.520]  I believe
[33:51.520 --> 33:53.520]  it.
[33:55.520 --> 33:57.520]  It's underscores.
[33:57.520 --> 33:59.520]  Why?
[33:59.520 --> 34:01.520]  It's underscores.
[34:01.520 --> 34:03.520]  These two, A, B.
[34:03.520 --> 34:05.520]  Easy.
[34:05.520 --> 34:07.520]  So in the app,
[34:07.520 --> 34:09.520]  this is also
[34:09.520 --> 34:11.520]  minimum sum of product.
[34:11.520 --> 34:13.520]  Okay, who cares?
[34:13.520 --> 34:15.520]  So this is sum of product, yes.
[34:15.520 --> 34:17.520]  This is sum of product.
[34:17.520 --> 34:19.520]  And this is
[34:19.520 --> 34:21.520]  the same.
[34:21.520 --> 34:23.520]  It is the minimum sum of product, yes.
[34:23.520 --> 34:25.520]  But it can be different.
[34:25.520 --> 34:27.520]  Another problem.
[34:27.520 --> 34:29.520]  Different problem can be different.
[34:29.520 --> 34:31.520]  I'm going to talk about this in more details.
[34:31.520 --> 34:33.520]  This is just introduction to
[34:33.520 --> 34:35.520]  what is coming now.
[34:35.520 --> 34:37.520]  And what I want you to know
[34:37.520 --> 34:39.520]  at this point is
[34:39.520 --> 34:41.520]  there are
[34:41.520 --> 34:43.520]  there is sum of product,
[34:43.520 --> 34:45.520]  there is sum
[34:45.520 --> 34:47.520]  of product, this is sum
[34:47.520 --> 34:49.520]  of product,
[34:49.520 --> 34:51.520]  there is something called
[34:51.520 --> 34:53.520]  standard sum of product,
[34:53.520 --> 34:55.520]  and there is minimum sum
[34:55.520 --> 34:57.520]  of product.
[34:57.520 --> 34:59.520]  And for some reason,
[34:59.520 --> 35:01.520]  some students get confused about
[35:01.520 --> 35:03.520]  the differences.
[35:05.520 --> 35:07.520]  Now you see
[35:07.520 --> 35:09.520]  if I'm missing two terms,
[35:09.520 --> 35:11.520]  what do I miss?
[35:11.520 --> 35:13.520]  I miss C,
[35:13.520 --> 35:15.520]  I miss D, then I multiply by
[35:15.520 --> 35:17.520]  C plus C bar,
[35:17.520 --> 35:19.520]  and I multiply by
[35:19.520 --> 35:21.520]  D plus D bar.
[35:21.520 --> 35:23.520]  What about here?
[35:23.520 --> 35:25.520]  I multiply by
[35:25.520 --> 35:27.520]  F
[35:29.520 --> 35:31.520]  here.
[35:31.520 --> 35:33.520]  I multiply by
[35:33.520 --> 35:35.520]  D plus
[35:35.520 --> 35:37.520]  D bar.
[35:37.520 --> 35:39.520]  So as I
[35:39.520 --> 35:41.520]  did in the previous example,
[35:41.520 --> 35:43.520]  I multiply
[35:43.520 --> 35:45.520]  until
[35:45.520 --> 35:47.520]  I get
[35:47.520 --> 35:49.520]  the last expression
[35:49.520 --> 35:51.520]  here. What is this?
[35:51.520 --> 35:53.520]  This is standard
[35:53.520 --> 35:55.520]  standard sum of product.
[35:55.520 --> 35:57.520]  Make sure to
[35:57.520 --> 35:59.520]  memorize the difference
[35:59.520 --> 36:01.520]  between sum of product,
[36:01.520 --> 36:03.520]  standard sum of product,
[36:03.520 --> 36:05.520]  minimum sum of product.
[36:07.520 --> 36:09.520]  Questions?
[36:15.520 --> 36:17.520]  We talked about standard
[36:17.520 --> 36:19.520]  sum of product, we did about sum
[36:19.520 --> 36:21.520]  of product, but here
[36:21.520 --> 36:23.520]  what do we have?
[36:23.520 --> 36:25.520]  We have here product
[36:25.520 --> 36:27.520]  of sum.
[36:27.520 --> 36:29.520]  Is this a product?
[36:29.520 --> 36:31.520]  Yeah, multiplication, multiplication.
[36:31.520 --> 36:33.520]  Is this sum?
[36:33.520 --> 36:35.520]  Yeah. So this
100.117.97.99 - - [30/Sep/2025 17:14:34] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
100.117.97.99 - - [30/Sep/2025 17:14:34] "GET /manifest.json HTTP/1.1" 404 -
100.117.97.99 - - [30/Sep/2025 17:14:34] "GET /static/style.css HTTP/1.1" 304 -
100.117.97.99 - - [30/Sep/2025 17:14:34] "GET /static/script.js HTTP/1.1" 304 -
100.117.97.99 - - [30/Sep/2025 17:14:34] "GET /sw.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -
100.117.97.99 - - [30/Sep/2025 17:14:34] "GET /history HTTP/1.1" 200 -
[36:35.520 --> 36:37.520]  is product of sum.
[36:39.520 --> 36:41.520]  We will see what is the standard
[36:41.520 --> 36:43.520]  product of sum.
[36:43.520 --> 36:45.520]  What is the minimum
[36:45.520 --> 36:47.520]  product of sum?
[36:51.520 --> 36:53.520]  Again here, if I hold
[36:53.520 --> 36:55.520]  one circle and another circle,
[36:55.520 --> 36:57.520]  they will cancel each other. Circle,
[36:57.520 --> 36:59.520]  another circle, circle, another
[36:59.520 --> 37:01.520]  circle means I got inverters.
[37:03.520 --> 37:05.520]  And if I have negative
[37:05.520 --> 37:07.520]  and this is equivalent to
[37:07.520 --> 37:09.520]  more.
[37:09.520 --> 37:11.520]  So I can design the same
[37:11.520 --> 37:13.520]  expression using
[37:13.520 --> 37:15.520]  one, two, three, four,
[37:15.520 --> 37:17.520]  more here.
[37:17.520 --> 37:19.520]  What about
[37:19.520 --> 37:21.520]  the standard?
[37:21.520 --> 37:23.520]  If I come to this
[37:23.520 --> 37:25.520]  expression
[37:25.520 --> 37:27.520]  and I want it in a truth table,
[37:27.520 --> 37:29.520]  I can put it in a truth table
[37:29.520 --> 37:31.520]  and how many
[37:31.520 --> 37:33.520]  rules I will have?
[37:33.520 --> 37:35.520]  I have A, B,
[37:35.520 --> 37:37.520]  C, D,
[37:37.520 --> 37:39.520]  then I will have 16.
[37:39.520 --> 37:41.520]  16 rules.
[37:43.520 --> 37:45.520]  So I will have
[37:45.520 --> 37:47.520]  16 rules.
[37:49.520 --> 37:51.520]  And
[37:53.520 --> 37:55.520]  I will, I can do that if it is
[37:55.520 --> 37:57.520]  required to convert the expression
[37:57.520 --> 37:59.520]  into truth table.
[38:01.520 --> 38:03.520]  So I will have 16 rules.
[38:05.520 --> 38:07.520]  One, two, three, 16.
[38:07.520 --> 38:09.520]  This is product of 0, 0, 0.
[38:09.520 --> 38:11.520]  And I have with
[38:11.520 --> 38:13.520]  1, 1, 1, 1.
[38:13.520 --> 38:15.520]  Now,
[38:15.520 --> 38:17.520]  in order to
[38:17.520 --> 38:19.520]  convert this A,
[38:19.520 --> 38:21.520]  B bar, C,
[38:21.520 --> 38:23.520]  to the standard
[38:23.520 --> 38:25.520]  product of sum,
[38:25.520 --> 38:27.520]  then I have
[38:27.520 --> 38:29.520]  to add D, D bar.
[38:29.520 --> 38:31.520]  Why?
[38:31.520 --> 38:33.520]  What is D, D bar?
[38:33.520 --> 38:35.520]  0.
[38:35.520 --> 38:37.520]  D, D bar is 0.
[38:37.520 --> 38:39.520]  So when I add 0, it will not
[38:39.520 --> 38:41.520]  change the expression.
[38:41.520 --> 38:43.520]  And then this will be
[38:43.520 --> 38:45.520]  A plus B bar plus C
[38:45.520 --> 38:47.520]  plus D times
[38:47.520 --> 38:49.520]  A plus B bar
[38:49.520 --> 38:51.520]  plus C plus D bar.
[38:51.520 --> 38:53.520]  We talked about this rule
[38:53.520 --> 38:55.520]  before, right?
[38:55.520 --> 38:57.520]  And whatever, whenever
[38:57.520 --> 38:59.520]  a variable is missing,
[39:01.520 --> 39:03.520]  here I don't miss any variable,
[39:03.520 --> 39:05.520]  so it will be the same as it is.
[39:05.520 --> 39:07.520]  Here I'm missing
[39:07.520 --> 39:09.520]  A.
[39:09.520 --> 39:11.520]  Then I will multiply by
[39:11.520 --> 39:13.520]  A, A bar,
[39:13.520 --> 39:15.520]  because A, A bar is 0.
[39:15.520 --> 39:17.520]  And then
[39:17.520 --> 39:19.520]  I will get
[39:19.520 --> 39:21.520]  the standard product
[39:21.520 --> 39:23.520]  of sum.
[39:23.520 --> 39:25.520]  So, so far,
[39:25.520 --> 39:27.520]  the bottom line, we showed a lot
[39:27.520 --> 39:29.520]  the standard sum of product.
[39:31.520 --> 39:33.520]  Just the sum of product
[39:33.520 --> 39:35.520]  and minimum sum of product.
[39:35.520 --> 39:37.520]  And also we will have
[39:37.520 --> 39:39.520]  just the product of sum,
[39:39.520 --> 39:41.520]  standard product of sum,
[39:41.520 --> 39:43.520]  and we will talk about
[39:43.520 --> 39:45.520]  minimum product of sum.
[39:47.520 --> 39:49.520]  And we talked about
[39:49.520 --> 39:51.520]  true stable.
[39:53.520 --> 39:55.520]  We talked about true stable.
[39:57.520 --> 39:59.520]  So,
[39:59.520 --> 40:01.520]  if I want
[40:01.520 --> 40:03.520]  to go from true stable,
[40:03.520 --> 40:05.520]  this is important.
[40:05.520 --> 40:07.520]  I want to go from true stable.
[40:07.520 --> 40:09.520]  This is the true stable.
[40:09.520 --> 40:11.520]  To standard
[40:11.520 --> 40:13.520]  sum of product.
[40:13.520 --> 40:15.520]  From the true stable
[40:15.520 --> 40:17.520]  to the standard sum of product.
[40:17.520 --> 40:19.520]  So I will look at
[40:19.520 --> 40:21.520]  the ones.
[40:21.520 --> 40:23.520]  This is one here,
[40:23.520 --> 40:25.520]  and I have one here, and I have one here.
[40:25.520 --> 40:27.520]  Then the Boolean
[40:27.520 --> 40:29.520]  expression is
[40:29.520 --> 40:31.520]  X equal
[40:31.520 --> 40:33.520]  X equal
[40:33.520 --> 40:35.520]  A bar, B bar, C
[40:35.520 --> 40:37.520]  plus
[40:37.520 --> 40:39.520]  A, B bar, C bar
[40:39.520 --> 40:41.520]  plus A, B, C.
[40:41.520 --> 40:43.520]  Questions?
[40:45.520 --> 40:47.520]  This is the standard
[40:47.520 --> 40:49.520]  sum of product.
[40:49.520 --> 40:51.520]  But if I have the same
[40:51.520 --> 40:53.520]  true stable, what I want
[40:53.520 --> 40:55.520]  to write the expression
[40:55.520 --> 40:57.520]  as
[40:57.520 --> 40:59.520]  standard product of sum.
[40:59.520 --> 41:01.520]  Standard product of
[41:01.520 --> 41:03.520]  sum, I will have,
[41:03.520 --> 41:05.520]  I will look at the zeros. How many zeros I have?
[41:05.520 --> 41:07.520]  Five.
[41:07.520 --> 41:09.520]  Then I will have
[41:09.520 --> 41:11.520]  five multiplication.
[41:11.520 --> 41:13.520]  I have A plus B plus C
[41:13.520 --> 41:15.520]  times A plus
[41:15.520 --> 41:17.520]  B bar plus C times
[41:17.520 --> 41:19.520]  A plus B bar plus C
[41:19.520 --> 41:21.520]  bar, and so on.
[41:25.520 --> 41:27.520]  Questions?
[41:29.520 --> 41:31.520]  So I can write
[41:31.520 --> 41:33.520]  the expression
[41:33.520 --> 41:35.520]  on the true stable as
[41:35.520 --> 41:37.520]  standard sum of product.
[41:37.520 --> 41:39.520]  Another solution,
[41:39.520 --> 41:41.520]  standard product of sum.
[41:41.520 --> 41:43.520]  For the standard
[41:43.520 --> 41:45.520]  sum of product, I will look at the ones.
[41:45.520 --> 41:47.520]  I will look at the ones,
[41:47.520 --> 41:49.520]  and I write the expression
[41:49.520 --> 41:51.520]  plus plus plus.
[41:53.520 --> 41:55.520]  How many pluses? I have to have
[41:55.520 --> 41:57.520]  one plus one plus
[41:57.520 --> 41:59.520]  one plus one.
[41:59.520 --> 42:01.520]  But if I
[42:01.520 --> 42:03.520]  want the standard product of
[42:03.520 --> 42:05.520]  sum, then one, two,
[42:05.520 --> 42:07.520]  three, four, five. Five
[42:07.520 --> 42:09.520]  zeros, then I will have
[42:09.520 --> 42:11.520]  five brackets.
[42:11.520 --> 42:13.520]  I'm going to write two
[42:13.520 --> 42:15.520]  positions.
[42:17.520 --> 42:19.520]  Now we
[42:19.520 --> 42:21.520]  are going to go to something interesting.
[42:21.520 --> 42:23.520]  I believe this is the most interesting
[42:23.520 --> 42:25.520]  thing in
[42:25.520 --> 42:27.520]  this course, which
[42:27.520 --> 42:29.520]  is called Carnot map.
[42:31.520 --> 42:33.520]  Carnot map will help
[42:33.520 --> 42:35.520]  me to minimize
[42:35.520 --> 42:37.520]  the expression
[42:37.520 --> 42:39.520]  without the need to go
[42:39.520 --> 42:41.520]  to the Julian algebra
[42:41.520 --> 42:43.520]  rules. That was rules.
[42:43.520 --> 42:45.520]  I can use this
[42:45.520 --> 42:47.520]  K map to reduce
[42:47.520 --> 42:49.520]  the expression.
[42:49.520 --> 42:51.520]  The way that we
[42:51.520 --> 42:53.520]  draw the K map,
[42:53.520 --> 42:55.520]  you can see I made
[42:55.520 --> 42:57.520]  one bit change.
[42:57.520 --> 42:59.520]  It is not zero, zero,
[42:59.520 --> 43:01.520]  and then one, and then two. No.
[43:01.520 --> 43:03.520]  It is one, one. It is three.100.117.97.99 - - [30/Sep/2025 17:14:42] "GET /queue_status HTTP/1.1" 200 -

[43:03.520 --> 43:05.520]  Why? Because there is one bit change
[43:05.520 --> 43:07.520]  here. So I can combine these
[43:07.520 --> 43:09.520]  two. Here
[43:09.520 --> 43:11.520]  I have A, B, C bar.
[43:11.520 --> 43:13.520]  Here I have A bar, B,
[43:13.520 --> 43:15.520]  C bar. So you can see
[43:15.520 --> 43:17.520]  only I have A, A bar,
[43:17.520 --> 43:19.520]  which means that
[43:19.520 --> 43:21.520]  I can take B,
[43:21.520 --> 43:23.520]  C bar,
[43:23.520 --> 43:25.520]  multiply by A plus A bar.
[43:25.520 --> 43:27.520]  What is A plus A bar?
[43:27.520 --> 43:29.520]  One.
[43:29.520 --> 43:31.520]  Right?
[43:31.520 --> 43:33.520]  So here, if I
[43:33.520 --> 43:35.520]  say this one plus this one,
[43:35.520 --> 43:37.520]  then I can quickly say
[43:37.520 --> 43:39.520]  it is B,
[43:39.520 --> 43:41.520]  C bar.
[43:41.520 --> 43:43.520]  B, C bar means
[43:43.520 --> 43:45.520]  B here is one,
[43:45.520 --> 43:47.520]  right? Look. One.
[43:47.520 --> 43:49.520]  And this is zero, then C
[43:49.520 --> 43:51.520]  bar. So I
[43:51.520 --> 43:53.520]  can quickly
[43:53.520 --> 43:55.520]  minimize the expression using
[43:55.520 --> 43:57.520]  K map by
[43:57.520 --> 43:59.520]  looking at the ones.
[43:59.520 --> 44:01.520]  So A bar, B,
[44:01.520 --> 44:03.520]  C bar. Suppose that
[44:03.520 --> 44:05.520]  I have the expression is just
[44:05.520 --> 44:07.520]  A bar, B,
[44:07.520 --> 44:09.520]  C bar plus A, B,
[44:09.520 --> 44:11.520]  C bar.
[44:11.520 --> 44:13.520]  Then what is the
[44:13.520 --> 44:15.520]  minimized version?
[44:15.520 --> 44:17.520]  I have one here,
[44:17.520 --> 44:19.520]  and one here.
[44:19.520 --> 44:21.520]  Then the minimized and the rest are
[44:21.520 --> 44:23.520]  zero, zero, zero,
[44:23.520 --> 44:25.520]  zero, zero, zero.
[44:27.520 --> 44:29.520]  So my question again
[44:29.520 --> 44:31.520]  is
[44:31.520 --> 44:33.520]  I want you
[44:33.520 --> 44:35.520]  to look at the table because I'm going
[44:35.520 --> 44:37.520]  to go to the camera now.
[44:37.520 --> 44:39.520]  First, I have
[44:39.520 --> 44:41.520]  A bar, B,
[44:41.520 --> 44:43.520]  C bar
[44:43.520 --> 44:45.520]  plus
[44:45.520 --> 44:47.520]  A, B, C bar.
[44:47.520 --> 44:49.520]  A, B, A bar.
[44:53.520 --> 44:55.520]  This is what I have.
[44:55.520 --> 44:57.520]  Then
[44:57.520 --> 44:59.520]  if I use the rules, then this will be
[45:01.520 --> 45:03.520]  right?
[45:03.520 --> 45:05.520]  Which is equal to
[45:05.520 --> 45:07.520]  B,
[45:07.520 --> 45:09.520]  C bar because A
[45:09.520 --> 45:11.520]  plus A bar equal one.
[45:11.520 --> 45:13.520]  If I
[45:13.520 --> 45:15.520]  look at
[45:15.520 --> 45:17.520]  the map,
[45:17.520 --> 45:19.520]  I can quickly do it because
[45:19.520 --> 45:21.520]  I can combine these two.
[45:21.520 --> 45:23.520]  I can put
[45:23.520 --> 45:25.520]  circle here,
[45:25.520 --> 45:27.520]  C bar,
[45:27.520 --> 45:29.520]  B bar.
[45:37.520 --> 45:39.520]  So for K-map, with three
[45:39.520 --> 45:41.520]  variables,
[45:41.520 --> 45:43.520]  A, B,
[45:43.520 --> 45:45.520]  C,
[45:45.520 --> 45:47.520]  zero, one,
[45:47.520 --> 45:49.520]  zero, zero,
[45:49.520 --> 45:51.520]  one, one, one,
[45:51.520 --> 45:53.520]  one, zero.
[45:59.520 --> 46:01.520]  This is what I have.
[46:01.520 --> 46:03.520]  For this exhibition,
[46:03.520 --> 46:05.520]  this is what I have.
[46:05.520 --> 46:07.520]  A bar, B, C bar.
[46:07.520 --> 46:09.520]  A bar,
[46:09.520 --> 46:11.520]  B, C bar.
[46:11.520 --> 46:13.520]  Plus A, B,
[46:13.520 --> 46:15.520]  C bar.
[46:15.520 --> 46:17.520]  A, B, one, one,
[46:17.520 --> 46:19.520]  C bar. This is what I have.
[46:21.520 --> 46:23.520]  Then I can do these two
[46:23.520 --> 46:25.520]  ones.
[46:25.520 --> 46:27.520]  And I can read it. It is C
[46:27.520 --> 46:29.520]  bar, A, B.
[46:33.520 --> 46:35.520]  Sorry.
[46:35.520 --> 46:37.520]  This is A, B.
[46:37.520 --> 46:39.520]  So I have A, B.
[46:39.520 --> 46:41.520]  And it is C bar,
[46:41.520 --> 46:43.520]  B.
[46:43.520 --> 46:45.520]  B is one, one.
[46:45.520 --> 46:47.520]  So from here,
[46:47.520 --> 46:49.520]  I can say that the exhibition is
[46:49.520 --> 46:51.520]  B,
[46:51.520 --> 46:53.520]  A,
[46:53.520 --> 46:55.520]  C bar.
[46:55.520 --> 46:57.520]  Questions?
[47:01.520 --> 47:03.520]  Again,
[47:03.520 --> 47:05.520]  these eight values
[47:05.520 --> 47:07.520]  can be in a close table.
[47:07.520 --> 47:09.520]  Right?
[47:09.520 --> 47:11.520]  Can be in a close table.
[47:11.520 --> 47:13.520]  Eight rows, three
[47:13.520 --> 47:15.520]  values.
[47:15.520 --> 47:17.520]  Now,
[47:17.520 --> 47:19.520]  it will end
[47:19.520 --> 47:21.520]  up that
[47:21.520 --> 47:23.520]  I will just need
[47:23.520 --> 47:25.520]  count of map with three values.
[47:25.520 --> 47:27.520]  You can do it this way or this way. It doesn't matter.
[47:27.520 --> 47:29.520]  And
[47:29.520 --> 47:31.520]  if I give you
[47:31.520 --> 47:33.520]  count of map
[47:33.520 --> 47:35.520]  A, B,
[47:35.520 --> 47:37.520]  C,
[47:37.520 --> 47:39.520]  zero, one,
[47:39.520 --> 47:41.520]  zero, one,
[47:41.520 --> 47:43.520]  zero, zero, one,
[47:43.520 --> 47:45.520]  one, one,
[47:45.520 --> 47:47.520]  one, one.
[47:47.520 --> 47:49.520]  If I give you some ones,
[47:49.520 --> 47:51.520]  for example,
[47:53.520 --> 47:55.520]  this,
[47:55.520 --> 47:57.520]  then you can group the ones
[47:57.520 --> 47:59.520]  and
[47:59.520 --> 48:01.520]  simplify the exhibition.
[48:01.520 --> 48:03.520]  So if the exhibition
[48:03.520 --> 48:05.520]  was a standard,
[48:05.520 --> 48:07.520]  what is the standard?
[48:07.520 --> 48:09.520]  The standard that you have one plus
[48:09.520 --> 48:11.520]  plus plus plus plus.
[48:11.520 --> 48:13.520]  This is the standard.
[48:13.520 --> 48:15.520]  What is the standard?
[48:15.520 --> 48:17.520]  X equal A, B,
[48:17.520 --> 48:19.520]  C bar.
[48:19.520 --> 48:21.520]  A, B,
[48:21.520 --> 48:23.520]  C bar.
[48:23.520 --> 48:25.520]  A,
[48:25.520 --> 48:27.520]  B,
[48:27.520 --> 48:29.520]  C,
[48:29.520 --> 48:31.520]  A,
[48:31.520 --> 48:33.520]  B,
[48:33.520 --> 48:35.520]  plus.
[48:35.520 --> 48:37.520]  A,
[48:37.520 --> 48:39.520]  B,
[48:39.520 --> 48:41.520]  C, plus.
[48:41.520 --> 48:43.520]  A,
[48:43.520 --> 48:45.520]  B,
[48:45.520 --> 48:47.520]  C bar.
[48:47.520 --> 48:49.520]  Plus,
[48:49.520 --> 48:51.520]  A,
[48:51.520 --> 48:53.520]  B,
[48:53.520 --> 49:01.360]  Plus, the last one is A, B bar, C bar.
[49:01.360 --> 49:02.920]  So this is the standard.
[49:02.920 --> 49:07.360]  This is the standard sum of products.
[49:07.360 --> 49:09.000]  What is the question?
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.160]  I want the minimum sum of products.
[49:14.160 --> 49:15.240]  I can group these two.
[49:15.240 --> 49:18.240]  No, I will group four.
[49:18.240 --> 49:22.040]  What is common about these four months?
[49:22.040 --> 49:26.960]  B is one, right?
[49:26.960 --> 49:29.040]  B is one.
[49:29.040 --> 49:32.440]  And C can be anything.
[49:32.440 --> 49:34.600]  It can be anything.
[49:34.600 --> 49:40.080]  So B. B means I concluded this four months.
[49:42.920 --> 49:46.840]  Plus, can I take this one alone?
[49:46.840 --> 49:50.480]  Can I say A, B bar, C bar?
[49:50.480 --> 49:51.640]  Possible.
[49:51.640 --> 49:56.720]  But this one is the solution.
[49:56.720 --> 50:04.600]  Instead of saying this one, this one is A, B bar.
[50:04.600 --> 50:11.120]  This one is A, B bar, and C bar, right?
[50:11.120 --> 50:20.400]  But this one is A, B, C bar.
[50:20.440 --> 50:22.640]  This one was this one.
[50:22.640 --> 50:24.880]  B plus B bar is one.
[50:24.880 --> 50:28.320]  Then it would be A, C bar.
[50:28.320 --> 50:30.520]  I can do it from here.
[50:30.520 --> 50:32.960]  A is one.
[50:32.960 --> 50:37.640]  A, C bar.
