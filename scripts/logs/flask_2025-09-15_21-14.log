[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  This is the end of chapter 3, chapter 2.
[00:04.000 --> 00:18.000]  And about more to the chapter 3, we started with how to open, or how to insert all these, how to write a video code inside.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  But not exactly just introduction.
[00:21.000 --> 00:33.000]  And then I only left three slides there for this chapter, and now we'll move to chapter 4 for how to record micro or micro.
[00:33.000 --> 00:42.000]  So IntelliSense, IntelliSense which is available for pretty much every language, so you know.
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  Right, and here if you click, if you do a lot of things, they save you time.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  I'm going to do on the left side.
[00:53.000 --> 01:11.000]  So we start with using the left side.
[01:11.000 --> 01:22.000]  And then developer, that's the first sentence you need to put in your insert to your Excel.
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.000]  And now once you insert your Avidar ribbon, it will be there, right?
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  So IntelliSense, and you can see all the colors.
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  IntelliSense refers to give you errors and help you write a little bit.
[01:40.000 --> 01:48.000]  Only one or two words, and then it will give you some hint, like for some keyword.
[01:48.000 --> 01:59.000]  If you type an integer, for example now we need to define a variable, like an integer, like a single or double.
[01:59.000 --> 02:12.000]  If you just write in, then it will write away and lead to, like here, define JS integer.
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  So if I just write in, then it will show integer on the right side.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  Then it will directly make it quickly.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  And also the color you can see here.
[02:25.000 --> 02:35.000]  And also if you just type this out, then it will give you, and for writing code here now,
[02:35.000 --> 02:52.000]  let's see, if I write a new sign, let's just write a new sign.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  Sub.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  So Sub, Sub team, when you write your code, always start with Sub.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  Then you need to have your name.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  Let's say pest.
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  Then you need a parenthesis.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  And then it will automatically give you an end sub.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  You just use space and it will give you that.
[03:18.000 --> 03:30.000]  And inside it will deem, deem, like deem M as, as you see.
[03:30.000 --> 03:37.000]  Whenever you use space, whenever you see here, as space, I'm touching space,
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  then it will show properties and message.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  You don't need, like if you type one word, one character, it will automatically give you that.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  You can just click.
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  So now I'm just doing integers, so I, surely everywhere.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  Then end, you see here integer.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  Then you just right click on the space, then it will begin.
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  You don't need to type lot.
[04:05.000 --> 04:18.000]  But also if you do the dot, if you say range, if I express range, let's say if I'm doing range, see, I'm doing range.
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  Then if you don't know what to do, you see here, you just type range.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  Then you click here, range.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  You just directly showing range message.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  How do you do, right?
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  You say sales, right?
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  It shows you sales, one sales, two sales, right?
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  And so on.
[04:42.000 --> 04:54.000]  Also, for example, I can just write range, let's say, because right inside it,
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  you need to have these quotes, double quotes.
[04:57.000 --> 05:09.000]  Let's say in one, so I'm pointing out in one sale, then if you just use dot, then it will choose dot.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  Whenever you use dot, it will choose the message.
[05:12.000 --> 05:21.000]  Like you want to, like, doing like a font, if I write font, write at all.
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  And these are all the message.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  And all can read.
[05:25.000 --> 05:32.000]  You see here, if I put a key in and delete there, and just move here, space, and so on.
[05:32.000 --> 05:40.000]  And also, like, if I want to type a message box, often showing you the results, what is that, right?
[05:40.000 --> 05:48.000]  Message box, starting with M-S-G, M-S-G as message box, B-G-O-S.
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  Then you do the space, see here, space.
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  So it will give you the message there.
[05:58.000 --> 06:07.000]  A lot of things, you see, you have to memorize, but we don't know how to memorize a lot of things like that, right?
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  So you see there, you know where you put, where you should put.
[06:12.000 --> 06:14.000]  That's in the case you don't know, right?
[06:14.000 --> 06:20.000]  So that's what refers these in palaces.
[06:20.000 --> 06:24.000]  Next, color.
[06:24.000 --> 06:27.000]  Case and color.
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  Case, in case V-B-N-E is case insensitive.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  But keyword always start.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  Keyword means, like, pivot table.
[06:40.000 --> 06:45.000]  These are keywords, like, it's reserved there, you cannot touch, right?
[06:45.000 --> 06:53.000]  And they have the first letter as capital, that's where you see all keywords start with capital letter.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  Make four loops, you want to start with four.
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  J is equal to one, then to five, and so on, and next, right?
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  So your next would be reserved there, and with capital N, okay?
[07:07.000 --> 07:12.000]  But in general, your names would be just okay, just case insensitive.
[07:12.000 --> 07:20.000]  So that really means if you use capital words and non-capital words, they are the same.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  But, however, it's always give you only one.
[07:25.000 --> 07:33.000]  Like, if you start with, like, start, like, if I start here, J, you see here, J.
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  D, the first one, D, J as integer.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  And that J is lower case.
[07:39.000 --> 07:48.000]  If you start, first one is lower case, then the rest one, if you even write upper case,
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  it will directly show you the lower case.
[07:51.000 --> 07:59.000]  But, however, if you just use, so that's for single word.
[08:00.000 --> 08:07.000]  But, however, often when you have your meaningful names, meaningful names,
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  like you don't want to make, like, sine theta, right?
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  I want value sine theta.
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  So what variable do you want to use?
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  You would probably use SIN, right?
[08:19.000 --> 08:25.000]  But SIN is reserved by them, so you don't want to use SIN, right?
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  And, because that's a function, right?
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  That's a function reserved.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  So I would use SINQ.
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  I use capital S here.
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  And often the reason why I use capital, that's what I always like to do.
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  The first one, capital order.
[08:46.000 --> 08:54.000]  If your words with two words, I would use either if your word use two words,
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.000]  make some cost as one word, like total of your cost, right?
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  And you put it there, that's your name.
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.000]  And then the name here, you put a C here, C-O-S-T, C there.
[09:09.000 --> 09:16.000]  So, next time whenever you write something wrong, you write a capital.
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  So, whatever you check, it's easy to check,
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  because whenever you change something, it doesn't change,
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  and then you know something wrong.
[09:24.000 --> 09:25.000]  That's what I do.
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  So I always put a capital either in S or in C.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  And so if you have a long name, you want to use one capital there,
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  so next time whenever you write, it's easy to detect if you lose.
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  If you're missing one word, one letter, right?
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  Because very often you don't want to miss if you use a sound.
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  If you suddenly write wrong, like S, you write as T.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  And so, but anyway, that's my experience.
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  I like to use one capital word at the beginning or in the middle of that
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  to show the difference, to see.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  Because this is a larger word, you can see easily your variable.
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  And so, so comments, comments are green,
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  and all the keywords are blue as you can see here.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  And I comment here, apostrophe, starting with apostrophe here,
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  then you see the keyword.
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  And by your code or variable, they're all black, right?
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  All black.
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  But if you do something wrong there, it will remind you.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  So it will show you that.
[10:49.000 --> 10:55.000]  For example, if I just write for something J, I missed equal.
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  Then it will tell you.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  If I missed equal, it will tell you, you missed equal sign.
[11:02.000 --> 11:12.000]  And for example here, if I just delete, see here,
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  it will say compile error, expect equal.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  Right, so you know.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  So that's something here.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  If you have a syntax error, it will remind you.
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  So it's not too bad.
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  So finally, all of these, if you want to know your open to work book,
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  it always goes to here.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  And that's VBA project.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  VBA projects.
[11:49.000 --> 11:56.000]  And that's from here.
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  From here, this is simple.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  Always choose what do you have.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  And you see here you have these, you have these.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  That's the solver, that's I have here inside.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  And that's this workbook, this workbook.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  And I have these.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  And if you have forms in the future, user forms, you know what you'll hear.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  And if you have charge, and you will hear.
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  So you see here you have worksheets.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  In worksheets also you could have charts.
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  So if you ever have charts, it will show you here.
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  So everything, everything will, if you want to see everything, then it's here.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  And if you want to change your module name, and module name is here,
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  modules means your video code, your subroutines, I mean your sound mode.
[12:54.000 --> 13:02.000]  Actually if you want to put a module inside, you can put several or many subroutines there.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  But your module is your module, it's your, I mean, kind of big sense.
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  Then you inside put all the subroutines to finish the work.
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  And so the module you just click on here.
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.000]  And then you click on the profile window.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  The name belongs to 40.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  So that's for the profile window.
[13:27.000 --> 13:33.000]  So for example, I want to change, if I want to change it on the left side now,
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  I want to change the name.
[13:35.000 --> 13:36.000]  Did you see here?
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  I can close them.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  I close them, then it's gone.
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  But now I highlight the sign for sign means, I highlight this.
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  And you can use these, you see here, profile windows to shoot.
[13:54.000 --> 14:02.000]  Then names I can say, okay, test, underscore test.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  And that's it.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  You see here, underscore test is shooting here.
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  So you can change whatever name you like.
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  Because if you're silent and I will ask you to change your module name,
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  so you will need to change your module name for different,
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  according to what I asked in your first assignment.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  I will announce it soon, a couple of days today or tomorrow.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  Okay.
[14:30.000 --> 14:39.000]  And then that's all for this.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  For the chapter.
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  For the chapter three.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  Oh, no.
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  No, I couldn't close.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  What should I do?
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  I might share.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  I'll do it here.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  I'll do it here.
[15:08.000 --> 15:18.000]  See if I can do.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  Okay, now I can do here.
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.000]  So that's the chapter three.
[15:27.000 --> 15:47.000]  Now I want to go to here.
[15:47.000 --> 15:57.000]  Now since I'm done with this, I'm going to show you.
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  Show the scene.
[16:02.000 --> 16:03.000]  You know what?
[16:03.000 --> 16:13.000]  I can do this.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  I can do this.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  Okay.
[16:15.000 --> 16:24.000]  So now, it's about the chapter.
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  Let's move to the recording module.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  Then we can get started to the real write code there.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  So what is module?
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  The module is just to do repetitive work.
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  Right.
[16:45.000 --> 16:55.000]  And a module, I know we say a module, it refers to a piece of code inside of your VBA editor.
[16:55.000 --> 17:02.000]  So whenever you record the module, you record the sequence.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  Then actually they write the code on the page.
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  So we don't need to write, so we say, without coding.
[17:10.000 --> 17:21.000]  So we don't need to do code, but they do by themselves.
[17:21.000 --> 17:29.000]  And so, module can do this easy work, but it cannot do the loops.
[17:29.000 --> 17:37.000]  It cannot do the controls and a lot of advanced database operations.
[17:37.000 --> 17:45.000]  And they cannot do on time collaborations, means they cannot do input or output.
[17:45.000 --> 17:53.000]  Because it's just you do from step one, then you do finally, and then you stop.
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.000]  And you cannot do anything, interact with them.
[17:57.000 --> 18:02.000]  So module cannot do a lot of things.
[18:02.000 --> 18:11.000]  So what we want to do, first, we will work with spreadsheet.
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  Then we're doing that.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  So spreadsheet, for the spreadsheet, let's say,
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  Oh, okay, I'm going to use my,
100.69.197.53 - - [15/Sep/2025 21:38:24] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
100.69.197.53 - - [15/Sep/2025 21:38:24] "GET /static/style.css HTTP/1.1" 200 -

[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  I'm going to show my spreadsheet.
[18:33.000 --> 18:41.000]  So spreadsheet, when you see here, I have the same, even on my menu space,
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  I have these two files uploaded there.
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  But you see the same names, but different extension.
[18:48.000 --> 18:53.000]  So one is Excel, the other is micro-enabled.
[18:53.000 --> 19:00.000]  You have M, so this one, you don't have the micro-enabled.
[19:00.000 --> 19:06.000]  So let me first show you here.
[19:06.000 --> 19:16.000]  Now back into the, what I want to do here is, not yet, but here.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  Let me see here.
[19:19.000 --> 19:27.000]  So graph, assign, and assign function, and staff.
[19:28.000 --> 19:34.000]  So what I write here is, what I want to do, what we want to do is,
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  first, if you want to do macro, first you need data, right?
[19:39.000 --> 19:47.000]  So now I just want to import sine curves.
[19:47.000 --> 19:53.000]  So you need data's angles, 0 to 360 degree, right?
[19:53.000 --> 19:58.000]  So first you import your angles in the column A.
[19:58.000 --> 20:04.000]  Then you need to write equations, I mean functions,
[20:04.000 --> 20:10.000]  and to calculate what is your sine theta, what is cosine theta, right?
[20:10.000 --> 20:16.000]  And then we can do the functions.
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  So let's first view your data.
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.000]  So now enter formula.
[20:22.000 --> 20:25.000]  This is enter formula.
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  We need to do how to enter our formula here.
[20:30.000 --> 20:39.000]  And how to do copy and paste, how to do auto-fill of this net creation chart.
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.000]  The copy and paste spatial values, probably you already know this,
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  and the sorting and format sales.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  What else you can do?
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  Of course, you have more than this.
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  These are the main things you can do, and for the spreadsheet.
[21:00.000 --> 21:10.000]  So opening cell, whenever you open cell, now if I just open a new,
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  this is a new Excel.
[21:13.000 --> 21:16.000]  So this is a new Excel.
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.000]  Then it always issues this one by default.
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  You can change its name.
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.000]  Then what is its address?
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  And how do it refers to each here?
[21:29.000 --> 21:37.000]  So we use this here, rows, 1 to many, and A, B, C, D to many.
[21:38.000 --> 21:45.000]  So we use A1 refers to this one, B1 refers to this one, L, and so on.
[21:45.000 --> 21:54.000]  So we start with character A, B, C, D, and then we use the number to express the position.
[21:57.000 --> 22:03.000]  Then now, for here, for the address, now as you can see here,
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  and if you want to use a range, A1 is here, but if you want a range,
[22:08.000 --> 22:16.000]  and you just annoying D2 and to D3, that's a range here, right?
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  And when you use range, you use here.
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.000]  You use the signs here.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  And now, next.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  As you can see here, this is a sale address.
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  As you already know, it use rows.
[22:39.000 --> 22:44.000]  The column use the letters to represent them.
[22:44.000 --> 22:50.000]  And this is the range.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  Now how do you enter your formula?
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  Formula bar is here.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  And also, sale name is here.
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000]  Whenever you highlight which of everywhere you choose here, that's your sale address.
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.000]  Formula bar. Formula bar always start with equal.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  Equal to what?
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  And this is worksheet.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  And you just worksheet.
[23:19.000 --> 23:25.000]  And on the right side, worksheet name, you can always change to whatever you like.
[23:25.000 --> 23:37.000]  Just rename. See here, rename to asset sheet.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  Or you can use test.
[23:43.000 --> 23:48.000]  And this plus sign always means insert.
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  So just insert.
[23:50.000 --> 23:56.000]  If you want to insert a chart, it always can insert a chart.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  See here, insert a chart.
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  So it can, and you just delete.
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.000]  Just delete.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  See here, right click, key.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  So if you highlight whatever you want to operate with whenever you just highlight them,
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  then right mouse, then you see all of these.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  And so now let's go back to the left.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  So sales address.
[24:28.000 --> 24:34.000]  Sales address, we have relative or absolute.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  You have two things.
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  Like A2, A1, this is relative.
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  And absolute refers to constant.
[24:48.000 --> 25:01.000]  And you see here, relative means whether you copy sales or you will copy relatively regarding that sales.
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.000]  And so let's say absolute reference refers to constant.
[25:07.000 --> 25:14.000]  If you want to use that variable in that sale, you don't want to change.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  You want to keep that as constant.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  You need to add the dollar sign.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  And that's for absolute reference.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  Now formula.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  Now formula bar is this bar, right?
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  This one is showing whichever highlights, right?
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  I want to highlight this.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  So now I have two, three.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  Now I want to do what?
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  I want to add these two, three to equal than that.
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  So it will show the formula you use.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  Now you can copy and paste.
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  You just copy these two past here.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  You don't need to redo everything, right?
[25:52.000 --> 26:00.000]  You can copy past or you can just drag to draw.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  Let me just show you here.
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.000]  This one on the right side.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.000]  See?
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  That's equal.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  Then if I just click this.
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  Now I wanted to operate this.
[26:14.000 --> 26:19.000]  You can just copy and paste.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  So paste.
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  Now because it's relative, so it will change in this position.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  It will add this, this.
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  So now I change it to the nine from eight, right?
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  And one way you can copy and just use copy.
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  The other way you can do it, you use plus.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  You place your mouse.
[26:44.000 --> 26:52.000]  Place the mouse to the bottom right corner, like this corner.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  Now I'm going to show you a plus sign.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  Then you just drag.
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  And so that's how you copy here all the time.
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  Copy and paste automatically.
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.000]  Now let's back to the left.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  Back to the left.
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  Now showing you what is the absolute reference.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  You need to use dollar sign.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  Right now you have A8, A8.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  You don't have dollar sign.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  Next you need a dollar sign to show that number doesn't change
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  the next time you do something.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  But how to do?
[27:31.000 --> 27:37.000]  I'm going to show you that when we are going to do the graph
[27:37.000 --> 27:43.000]  sign or cosine, I do need to have a constant number, which
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  is conversion factor.
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  I need to convert the degree to the radian.
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.000]  So the dollar sign, you might want to say you don't need
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  to use dollar sign when you have dollar sign too much to work.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  Just use F4.
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  Just click on that cell and click on F4.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  It directly gives you.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  But some computer may be, laptop may be different.
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  If it doesn't work, use F4.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  They use function.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  You use F.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  F4.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  It goes together.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  I have several different computers.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  Some I have to use this.
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  And then you have the absolute address.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  OK.
[28:38.000 --> 28:45.000]  So next, I will see when on rotation.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  That you see here.
[28:48.000 --> 28:58.000]  When we say rotation, we have A1 rotation.
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  When is A1 rotation?
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  Did you see here?
[29:01.000 --> 29:10.000]  A1 rotation means the relative address.
[29:10.000 --> 29:13.000]  This one.
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  Sorry.
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.000]  This refers to one type of rotation.
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  This refers to another type of rotation.
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.000]  But by default, Excel just use this A1 rotation.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  And this one is not default.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  R1 and C1.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  Not default.
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  I'm going to show you here.
[29:36.000 --> 29:46.000]  Now, R1, C1 rotation, if you click here on the right side,
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000]  use here, use option, use formula.
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  Then you will see here.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  That's what you see.
[29:54.000 --> 29:56.000]  R1, C1, reference.
[29:56.000 --> 29:58.000]  But usually, we don't do that.
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.000]  OK.
[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  Just to let you know, this is the option.
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.000]  But we don't really use that.
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  But you might wonder why we don't use it.
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  Why do we need to use this?
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.000]  When you do the markup, and the markup
[30:14.000 --> 30:19.000]  express this address using the R1, C1 location
[30:19.000 --> 30:23.000]  for you to operate this thing.
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  OK.
[30:24.000 --> 30:32.000]  So we said in A1 location, you have absolute and relative
[30:32.000 --> 30:33.000]  reference.
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  Absolute use dollar sign.
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  And now, look at these case.
[30:39.000 --> 30:46.000]  R1, C1, R refers to row, row number, column number.
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.000]  So this still refers to A1.
[30:49.000 --> 30:53.000]  They are corresponding to C. This is row one and column one.
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  But now, we have these.
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  When you look at here, sorry, this reference in here
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  can be represented as this.
[31:06.000 --> 31:12.000]  And as all these spaces just as that, like R2, C3.
[31:12.000 --> 31:19.000]  And here, you have the bracket here.
[31:19.000 --> 31:22.000]  And the bracket here now, inside,
[31:22.000 --> 31:25.000]  you have M and N, which is the number.
[31:25.000 --> 31:28.000]  And in here is the relative one.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  And this one is absolute one.
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  This one is relative one.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  Relative one means you can do IJ, IJ.
[31:37.000 --> 31:38.000]  You can operate.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  You can write your code to do a lot of things.
[31:43.000 --> 31:43.500]  OK.
[31:49.000 --> 31:53.000]  So now, I have these.
[31:57.000 --> 32:04.000]  Now, how do you know each corresponds to each?
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.000]  Like R2, C4.
[32:07.000 --> 32:11.000]  What does that correspond to A1 location?
[32:11.000 --> 32:17.000]  First, this 2 and 4 means they are absolute value.
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  They don't have the bracket.
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.000]  So absolute value corresponding to the total sign.
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  Row 2 then corresponds here.
[32:26.000 --> 32:32.000]  Column 4, column 4, A, B, C, D. So that's D.
[32:32.000 --> 32:38.000]  So that's how equivalent in the two locations.
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  OK.
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  Now, question.
[32:45.000 --> 32:48.000]  I have a question here.
[32:48.000 --> 32:57.000]  F13 in R1, C1 location, what will be?
[32:57.000 --> 33:01.000]  What will be the cell address in here?
[33:01.000 --> 33:05.000]  So rows will be should be what?
[33:05.000 --> 33:07.000]  Rows will be should be 13.
[33:07.000 --> 33:09.000]  So should be R13.
[33:09.000 --> 33:18.000]  And column F, 1, C, D, C, D. So 6, 9.
[33:18.000 --> 33:24.000]  So that's how you wanted to see what is the address of these
[33:24.000 --> 33:26.000]  in R1, C1 location.
[33:26.000 --> 33:30.000]  Then you should know, should be able to write what
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.000]  would be corresponding number.
[33:32.000 --> 33:34.000]  And what would be first?
[33:34.000 --> 33:38.000]  This is absolute value corresponding to the total
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  absolute value.
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  So you just write R, what?
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  Rows 13, C, 6.
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  And now look up here.
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.000]  This one refers to relative or absolute?
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  Relative, because you have bracket.
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  And in A1 and location.
[34:02.000 --> 34:06.000]  And then we don't need to have dollar sign.
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  So column 4 is D. So it should be D.
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.000]  And so it should be D5.
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  And so that's how you do each.
[34:25.000 --> 34:28.000]  Now how do you create formula?
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  How do you create formula in A1 itself?
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.000]  And I'm going to use all of these.
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  You always start with equal sign.
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  Then multiplication, division, power is correct.
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.000]  And the compatibilization is use string, use unsolved.
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.000]  And always you start with equal sign.
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.000]  Now that's what I have here now you can see.
[35:06.000 --> 35:18.000]  In this C3, C3 equal S2RT is the function for square root.
[35:18.000 --> 35:25.000]  Square root A3 square is this square plus E3 square.
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  And then you use n time.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  And it will be cut.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  Then you copy down to here.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  That's how you do it there.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  And that's the steps here.
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  You probably see here, square root.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  I don't have that.
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  I just copy it.
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.000]  So you just equal this.
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  See, why does it rewrite?
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  You just have to equal.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  That's QRT.
[36:05.000 --> 36:12.000]  When I'm going to put as QRT then you just place to this.
[36:12.000 --> 36:20.000]  So it will give you then root, character, and class.
[36:20.000 --> 36:28.000]  And that's E3, and then part, and then two, parentheses.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  So that's how you do.
[36:38.000 --> 36:45.000]  And these are the two different signs, QRT and also the signs
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  of multiplications.
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  And that's functions.
100.117.97.99 - - [15/Sep/2025 21:40:49] "GET /status/14 HTTP/1.1" 200 -

[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  Now, many of these given functions,
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.000]  mathematical function or sub-economic functions,
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  and as you can see some, average minimum mathematical
[37:03.000 --> 37:10.000]  count, quantity, and sine, cosine, tangent, and square root,
[37:10.000 --> 37:17.000]  absolute value, logarithm, and expansion, more, more,
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  rather, rather you turn, long, you run up, run down.
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  And PMT.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  PMT, you will be using PMT.
[37:28.000 --> 37:34.000]  You will be using PMT function to find the mortgage
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.000]  in your assignment number one.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  And we look.
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  We look up, we look up, and match.
[37:45.000 --> 37:54.000]  These are all useful functions, the sum if and average if.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  And these are the functions sometimes you need to use.
[38:00.000 --> 38:11.000]  OK, so now in here, in here correspond to how do you do this.
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  Here's the explanation for the formula, I mean, A1 and R1, C1.
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.000]  I mean, R1, C1 formula.
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  Sorry, this should be R1, C1 formula.
[38:27.000 --> 38:33.000]  And this corresponds to write something in the cell A2,
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  write something in the cell A2.
[38:35.000 --> 38:45.000]  If it's equal to B5 plus 2, then if on R1, C1 notation, what do you do?
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  So you need to see what is B5 relative to A2?
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  What is B5?
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  What is B5?
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  B5 should be here.
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.000]  A2 should be here.
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  So you should, you want to move right side by one column,
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  move down by one, two, three.
[39:07.000 --> 39:14.000]  So thus, you move down three, you move column by one.
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.000]  Right side we use plus sign, and going down we use plus sign.
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  Left side we use negative.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  Up we use negative.
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.000]  That's why if we go through here, at E3 position,
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  if you write it in E3 position to the equation of this,
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  then correspond to the R1, C1 formula with this.
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.000]  This all refers to virtual cells right now to sit on.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  See here.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  And B2 is on the left side, right?
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  So that's the reason.
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.000]  Because this is column shifted to the left by three.
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.000]  And we shift rows to the up by one, so we have minus one.
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.000]  And for here, and we only have the column to shift.
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  See here, column shift by one, but rows no shift.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  So no shift, you don't need to write.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  But you don't need to just, zero you don't need to write.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  And then sum.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  And sum, if sum be general,
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  this is the sum in the A1 notation.
[40:28.000 --> 40:35.000]  If I want to see sum of the number here from C1 to C5.
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  See sum, C1 to C5.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  Okay.
[40:39.000 --> 40:45.000]  Then, okay, then in this notation,
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  and it's in the same column.
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  And so you don't, you have column, just column C.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  But it's more up.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  More up by five.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  Two more up by one.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  So starting from here to here.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  So that's minus five, and then minus one.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  And that's how we do it.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  But if in the same column, you don't even need to write column.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  Just write that.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  That's all fine.
[41:11.000 --> 41:18.000]  So that's how you can understand the different communications.
[41:22.000 --> 41:30.000]  Okay, those are the most common sale errors here.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  After you want to see.
[41:52.000 --> 42:09.000]  So we have different errors, as you can see here.
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  Not horrible.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  Different size.
[42:11.000 --> 42:19.000]  Different size corresponds with different meaning of errors in Excel.
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  You might see some multiple choice questions regarding this.
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.000]  Giving you what is the sign correspond, what meaning of that.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  Asking you to select.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  Standing for that.
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  Like here, not available.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  And A, not available.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  And invalid.
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.000]  If you have quantizer of these, where is this exclamation?
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  Invalid.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  As you see here, with this invalid.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  Now means not.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  So empty valid.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  And division by zero, as you can see.
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  And couldn't find name, you see?
[42:58.000 --> 42:59.000]  Question mark.
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  Couldn't find name.
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  And couldn't find the reference.
[43:02.000 --> 43:03.000]  No reference.
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  And invalid.
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.000]  And this one, if you see this, you really just drag to the right side.
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  The color of the waves is too small.
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  Just drag to the right side.
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  Then you can see it.
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  Couldn't display values.
[43:24.000 --> 43:25.000]  Now.
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  For example here.
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  This one, actually, I'm showing you ways we look.
[43:34.000 --> 43:35.000]  We look up.
[43:35.000 --> 43:36.000]  We look up.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  You might use we look up in the future.
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  In your work.
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  If you use Excel, you don't use VBA.
[43:44.000 --> 43:51.000]  We look up the function as lookup value.
[43:51.000 --> 43:58.000]  So on the first column, you see here, this is the formula you write.
[43:58.000 --> 43:59.000]  V lookup.
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.000]  I have this ID and name.
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  Gender.
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.000]  Age.
[44:05.000 --> 44:13.000]  Now if I wish to use one column, the first column, to find the rest of information.
[44:13.000 --> 44:18.000]  For example, I want to type 205.
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  Then I want to know what is the name.
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.000]  In the case you have so many sirens, sirens, you couldn't look.
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  You want to use this, right?
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  So that's the L7.
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  Means I want to look up this number.
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  Relative of the names of that.
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.000]  Should be this one, right?
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  So where do you want to look?
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  You want to look at this range.
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  So that's the range.
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  You look.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  Then what is the column?
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  Which information you want to look?
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  You want to look at column two.
[44:53.000 --> 44:54.000]  One, two.
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  So you want to look at the names.
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  Force means exact match.
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  Exact match.
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  So that's how you do.
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  And then you have this, and then you can find this.
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  But in the case of here, you couldn't.
[45:10.000 --> 45:15.000]  Because we had a long of here.
[45:15.000 --> 45:16.000]  Base.
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  Let's see.
[45:21.000 --> 45:22.000]  This one.
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  See here.
[45:23.000 --> 45:24.000]  See here.
[45:24.000 --> 45:25.000]  I have the red.
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  Because the range, I used the wrong range.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  I was supposed to use the range of here, right?
[45:31.000 --> 45:36.000]  So that's why it shows wrong range.
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.000]  Then next is the values.
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.000]  If you use the values, invalid value, it comes out.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  This is the values.
[45:49.000 --> 45:55.000]  If you use the values, invalid value, because in here,
[45:55.000 --> 46:02.000]  I have this amount, which is quantity times price times.
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  But here, I have a string.
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  Then, of course, I have arrow.
[46:08.000 --> 46:09.000]  And so on.
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  You can check all of these.
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.000]  And I have all the reasons.
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  And this is a typo.
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.000]  If I have a typo, then it means.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  Because now, what is this?
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  Average.
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  Average is supposed to have average.
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  I type a wrong function.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  It should have an e, right?
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  So you couldn't.
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  So that's a typo.
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.000]  So so on.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  And this one is divided by 0.
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  And this one, you see things.
[46:48.000 --> 46:49.000]  Couldn't see.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  Just drive to here, you can see.
[46:52.000 --> 46:53.000]  You see?
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  You couldn't see.
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  So these are the values.
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.000]  And this one is missing.
[47:03.000 --> 47:08.000]  It's missing the common sign.
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  So I couldn't have that.
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.000]  And this one, you do have a sign.
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  And now, what about this?
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  Invalid number.
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  And because now square root, you have a negative, right?
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  So of course, you don't have.
[47:24.000 --> 47:28.000]  So these are, now let's go back.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  These are the settings.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  Now, these are the errors.
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  You can just take a look.
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  Now, next is how we are going to do manually if you're in
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.000]  create this.
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.000]  We first want to manually create this graph.
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  Then we're going to do a macro.
[47:54.000 --> 47:57.000]  And manually, you want to do that.
[47:57.000 --> 48:03.000]  And now, I'm going to close first.
[48:04.000 --> 48:10.000]  I'm going to create the, okay?
[48:10.000 --> 48:19.000]  Now, first, as you can see on the left slides, and it's, you
[48:19.000 --> 48:27.000]  open and you, of course, first, you want to add these settings,
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  right?
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.000]  Add these title and degree, just write the degree to the,
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  what is this?
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  This is conversion, degree to the reading.
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  So what did I write?
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  I write pi and divide by 180 degrees.
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.000]  That should be the absolute scale you need.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  Then I need theta, 80 degrees.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  If you couldn't find theta, you can just highlight this and
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  select it to symbol for this one.
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  Q actually is symbol for theta.
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.000]  So you can write beautifully all these just to type the settings
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  there, okay?
[49:12.000 --> 49:18.000]  Now, next is I need to input the degrees, right?
[49:18.000 --> 49:27.000]  And degree, I can put zero and five, and next should be 10
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  and 15, right?
[49:29.000 --> 49:34.000]  But you don't want to do, you want to auto-fill, right?
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  So auto-fill, how do you auto-fill?
[49:36.000 --> 49:42.000]  You just highlight them two such that you let, you still
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  know you want to increment by five, right?
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.000]  And then you look at the right side of this and fill handle.
[49:51.000 --> 49:59.000]  You see here I put my mouse and, see here, I put my mouse to here,
[49:59.000 --> 50:05.000]  right bottom, so you choose plus sign, plus sign which is a handle.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  Then you just use these.
[50:08.000 --> 50:17.000]  Oops, sorry.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  Sorry.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  I must missed.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  This is very good.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  Okay.
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.000]  You have to have these, not losing them.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  Okay.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  See here.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  So it's automatically towards here.
[50:37.000 --> 50:43.000]  Now towards here, I need to write a degree to the rating.
[50:43.000 --> 50:51.000]  So I want to equal, first equal this one higher than this.
[50:51.000 --> 50:56.000]  This number is not good enough because if you want to use these,
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  and for the first number it's good, and for the next number I will
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  just copyright value because of what?
[51:04.000 --> 51:09.000]  They try to find the number in here because whenever you shift,
[51:09.000 --> 51:13.000]  whenever you here, you find the number here, and here they find the
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  number here.
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  And if you go moving down, you're moving down, right?
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  So it doesn't work.
[51:19.000 --> 51:23.000]  So that's invalid number because this is three.
[51:23.000 --> 51:28.000]  So, you know, that's the reason now you need absolute value.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  It doesn't change the scale.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  So now you put out four.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  My out four doesn't work.
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  Let's see my out four.
[51:38.000 --> 51:43.000]  I use function fn in here.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  So now I would be good.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  See here.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  I would be all good.
[51:48.000 --> 51:55.000]  Now if you don't want to, now if you do, you would be all attractive here,
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  right?
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.000]  But now you take your time, right?
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  I'm going to show you next to how to do that.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  So we continue to here equal sign.
[52:09.000 --> 52:22.000]  This one would be sign, then this angle, and then cosine, then this angle.
[52:22.000 --> 52:34.000]  Then I want to just write one more of these square plus this square,
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  oh, sorry, square equal.
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  Oh, sorry.
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  I should use c.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  I should use d.
[52:48.000 --> 52:53.000]  So now I'm having equation formula there.
[52:53.000 --> 52:57.000]  Now I want it to auto-field.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  How do we auto-field?
[52:59.000 --> 53:10.000]  You can just aim here to select and see the left of these three.
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  Two will.
[53:13.000 --> 53:20.000]  Two e, 75.
[53:20.000 --> 53:29.000]  I'm going to use the two c.
[53:29.000 --> 53:33.000]  Left side, you know.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  Oh, that's not it.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  That's only, I already taught.
[53:38.000 --> 53:46.000]  I'm going to use the two next to each other.
[53:46.000 --> 53:52.000]  So that's what I have done so far.
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  Next, drag to everything.
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.000]  Now I want to do auto-field.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  How do you do auto-field?
[54:01.000 --> 54:07.000]  You just use control-t, and this is e, 75.
[54:07.000 --> 54:11.000]  And you need to use enter.
[54:11.000 --> 54:17.000]  Enter to select, then control-d.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  Give it all.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  That's it.
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  That's how you can do.
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  Then next.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  Let us look at the left side.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  Then you select bridges just to plot, right?
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  Just plot.
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  Select a region that you insert towards here.
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  Chart, use here.
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  Right. It will give you.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  And then use design.
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.000]  Design first, add a chart element.
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.000]  You can do the x and y.
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.000]  And also you can add a legend and so on.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  That's how you do the graph.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  And this is the title.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  And this is x, y.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  You can write at this.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  This is the legend.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  You can move actually.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  You can move.
[55:18.000 --> 55:25.000]  Now, and also you can change this number by doing that.
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.000]  Right here.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  You can change here.
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  Now next, I'm going to show you.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  So this is the graph.
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.000]  And next I'm going to.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  Okay.
[55:41.000 --> 55:49.000]  On the left side, I do have more to show you.
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.000]  If you're doing this, select left-b, this is three.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  It will show you the rating.
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.000]  I'm rating, but if I wish to show you the rating, it should be here.
[56:00.000 --> 56:08.000]  And then if you wish to change each of the sign.
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  You see here.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  You can change this to A.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  A, you can just change it here.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  See here.
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  And change this one, wouldn't be good.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  So, because this number will be degree, right?
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  And that's how you make a change.
[56:33.000 --> 56:38.000]  You can change from the degree to there to use the number here.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  Okay.
[56:39.000 --> 56:46.000]  And also if you want to add a legend, you can add a legend here.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  You see here.
[56:49.000 --> 56:57.000]  A in the front of here, you just type all these double quotes with your legend.
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.000]  That's how you look the difference.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  Right?
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  Okay.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  So that's how you.
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  The reason why I want to, I dare use this range.
[57:12.000 --> 57:16.000]  Starting from B because the X is B.
[57:16.000 --> 57:22.000]  If I use A, X is A, but it will give me three curve.
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  Then that curve will give, which I don't.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  You can do that, then you delete that curve.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  You can do this.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  Right?
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  It will show you three.
[57:34.000 --> 57:41.000]  And with one that is linear for the first one, then you delete that to give you the next two.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  Right?
[57:42.000 --> 57:48.000]  And you can do all the different things by trying to do the different work.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  Did you see here?
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.000]  Because it's all starting from the first column as your class.
[57:55.000 --> 57:56.000]  Right?
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.000]  So you just delete the other one.
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  Delete this one.
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.000]  Linear curve as the degree.
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  See?
[58:05.000 --> 58:06.000]  Right.
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  That's how you do differences.
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  Okay.
[58:10.000 --> 58:13.000]  And finally, okay.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  So that's how you do.
[58:15.000 --> 58:21.000]  And next I'm going to show you how to recall micro.
[58:21.000 --> 58:26.000]  And now first you want to protect your sheet.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  How do you protect your sheet?
[58:28.000 --> 58:35.000]  And you use the protect your sheet view review.
[58:35.000 --> 58:36.000]  In the review.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  It's in the review.
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  On the website in the review you have protect.
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  So now you just protect click okay.
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  Now I cannot do anything.
[58:46.000 --> 58:48.000]  You just cannot do anything.
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  Because it's protected.
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  Now I'm protected.
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  Okay.
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  Now you can rename as I said.
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  You can rename here, just here rename.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  Right?
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  And you can add nodes.
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.000]  Add nodes is just in here.
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.000]  And insert.
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  So you can add text box.
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.000]  If you want to add text box it's here.
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.000]  And so on you can format cells.
[59:17.000 --> 59:22.000]  If you want to see here, just right click format cells.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  And you can go to different numbers.
[59:25.000 --> 59:26.000]  See here.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  Will not give you too many numbers.
[59:28.000 --> 59:29.000]  Right?
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.000]  And so on.
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  You can do many of the things.
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  You can highlight.
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  Highlight column or rows.
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  If I want to highlight this.
[59:38.000 --> 59:39.000]  No no.
[59:39.000 --> 59:40.000]  Hide.
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  You cannot see.
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.000]  So that's how you hide.
[59:45.000 --> 59:48.000]  You can also hide sheet.
[59:48.000 --> 59:50.000]  And insert column.
[59:50.000 --> 59:53.000]  Just go in here.
[59:53.000 --> 59:54.000]  Insert.
[59:54.000 --> 59:55.000]  Okay.
[59:55.000 --> 59:58.000]  And now I'm going to come back.
[59:58.000 --> 59:59.000]  Unhide.
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  Unhide.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  Unhide.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  Unhide.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  Right.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  Unhide.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  So.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  And also if you copy a worksheet.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  If you want to say okay I want to copy.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  If you're doing something you don't want me to do.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  Then you copy here.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  You see here.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  Let's copy exactly the same.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  So you can play with the other sheet.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Right?
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  And then that's.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  Next.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  She's name.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  And she's.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  Insert worksheet.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  Insert worksheet as I said.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  You're just doing that.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  It's insert worksheet.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  Just using this.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  Then.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  We want to do macro.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  What you want to do.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  You see here.

[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  Hmm.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  In here.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  In here.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  In here.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  In here.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  In here.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  In here.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  In here.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  In here.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  In here.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  In here.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  In here.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  In here.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Okay.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  First I'm going to do copy this.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  Because I don't want to miss.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  I want to save time.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  I want to save time.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  Okay.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  I did copy here.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  Then now you do.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  Now I copy here.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Now I'm going to do the macro.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  So whenever you do the macro.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  You see here.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  In the dev app.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  On the left side.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Then you go to the dev app.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  Recall.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  You see here.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Recall.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  Recall.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  Recall.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  Recall.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  Recall.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  Recall.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Recall.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  Recall.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  Recall.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  Recall.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Okay.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  Recall.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  Okay.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  Recall the macro.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  This is my command.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  Just click okay.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  Then now it's recording.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  Whatever you're doing.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  It's something.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  It will automatically write code in the dev app.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  So what I want to do first.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  I'm going to do what?
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  Select this first.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  Select first cell.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  Then I put a zero.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  Then I put a five.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Right?
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  Then I select this.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  To five.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Then final handle.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  Then copy that to seventy five.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  To three hundred sixty.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  Three hundred sixty.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  Then I'm going to here to write equation of.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  Use this number.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  And after four.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  After four.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  And times.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  This equal.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  Then use these.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  Sign.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  This number.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  And then cosine.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  This.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  And then equal.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  This square.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  Oh no sorry.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  This square.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  Square plus.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  This square.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  Equal.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  I'm done.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Now I'm going to select this.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  So B3.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Then E.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  Seventy five.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  Enter.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Then control D.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  That's it.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  I'm done with this.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  So I'm stop.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  Recording.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  So I'm done now.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  I already stop.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  So now if you look at VBA here now.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  You supposed to see here.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  You do have automatically generate module.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  As you can see here.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  Okay.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  And it will give you what did you do.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  And what's the results.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  You see here.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  The notation.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  So I'm going to you see the left.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  Now you're going to see the left.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  And now you do.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  These are the code inside here.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  Now.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  If you don't.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  Now if you want to.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  You want to run this code.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  You need to go here.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  Insert.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  Control button.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  Right.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  So you have plus sign.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  And then you just use your mouse to.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Then connect.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Connect them to the module 1.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  This module 1 is your code.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  Right.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  So.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  That's the 1.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  And then you can change.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  Wrong button.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  Wrong program.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  That's how you can do.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Now I can.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  We can.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  Just test this.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  So we just clear content.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  We don't have anything right.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  That's what we have to do.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  Right.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  Then we just.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  Click it.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  It's there.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  So that's how you want.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  Of course here the plot.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  The graph is.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  If you already have the graph.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  Then it graph will show.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Right.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  If the graph is showing there directly.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  Then it will show.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  Let me just use this.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  Let me just use this quickly.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  The graph.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  That.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  Insert.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  The graph.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  Right.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  And just keep quickly.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  Just.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  I'm not going to make it beautiful.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  Just like that.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  Right.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  Now I'm going to.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  Clear.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  Then.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  I'm going to do wrong button.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  Just click on the button.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  Wrong.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  Right.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  That's how it can automatically work.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  Here.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  And you can.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  As I said.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  You can change your wrong button.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  And then.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  And the explanation.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  Of here.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  Of the code.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  You can check whatever code.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  It will give.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  To.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  Relative to what.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  Okay.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  So now.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  Finally.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  Finally.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  Finally.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  What.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  Marguerite can do.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  What cannot do.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  This automatically in your work.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  If you want to do.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  You can.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  You can.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  Do.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  Right.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  And.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  But.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  However.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  Can we do.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  It.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  No.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  You cannot.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  So you have to.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  We have to.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  Learn.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  How to.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  Right.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  And.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  You.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  Are.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  Going to.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  Let's.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000]  You.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  Know.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  You.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  Right.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  And.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  Right.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  And.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  You.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  Are.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  Going to.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  Learn.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  This.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  And.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  You.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  Right.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  To.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Find.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  The.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  Most.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  Great.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Even.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  The constant.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  Great.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  So you need to use.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  The absolute.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Right.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  And.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  You need to do the.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  The right.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  Form.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  Right.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  And.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  To.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  Do.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  The.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  Calculation.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  And.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  Also.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  You need to.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  Input.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  One number.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  Like.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  A.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  Rate.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  From.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  Where to where.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  From like.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  2%.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  To.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  5%.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  Then.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  You want to see.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  Your loans.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  If you want to loan a car.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  Like.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  Ten.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  Ten thousand.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  Pay.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  That.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  You need to pay.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Months.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  For how many years.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  You need to pay.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  You need to pay.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  For how many years.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  You need to pay.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  For how many years.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  If you want to get the car.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Or the car.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  Or.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  That.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  You need to pay.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  For how many years.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  You need to pay.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  For how many years.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  And.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  So.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  When you do it.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  So that's.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  We'll be.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  Your first.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  Assignment.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  Will be.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  Putting.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Your.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  Dropbox.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  And assignment.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  In assignment.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  For the school.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  A couple of days.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  Right.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  And so.

[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  So I can have the participation link.
[00:02.800 --> 00:04.440]  I completely forgot about this class.
[00:04.440 --> 00:05.400]  I'm really sorry.
[00:05.400 --> 00:07.640]  So I didn't bear that a minute.
[00:07.640 --> 00:08.320]  So it's fine.
[00:08.320 --> 00:11.440]  If you haven't done it, do so today.
[00:11.440 --> 00:13.800]  That was for the previous week.
[00:13.800 --> 00:18.000]  And then what I will do is, every Wednesday in the newsfeed,
[00:18.000 --> 00:22.000]  I will just put up the participation survey link
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.520]  for the week that we've just completed.
[00:24.520 --> 00:28.000]  So try and answer as honestly as possible.
[00:30.360 --> 00:33.440]  And that's that.
[00:33.440 --> 00:35.680]  And then what are we going to cover today?
[00:35.680 --> 00:37.760]  I'm going to try and, well, I'm going
[00:37.760 --> 00:40.680]  to definitely cover research.
[00:40.680 --> 00:43.200]  I'm also going to delve into personality.
[00:43.200 --> 00:46.200]  But I don't want to fall too behind.
[00:46.200 --> 00:50.360]  So what might happen is, on Wednesday, I
[00:50.360 --> 00:51.680]  will try and cover learning.
[00:51.680 --> 00:54.280]  But then I'll record myself with whatever I miss,
[00:54.280 --> 00:56.600]  because I kind of want to be on pace with everyone else.
[00:56.600 --> 01:00.200]  And I don't want to rush through the things at the very end
[01:00.200 --> 01:02.720]  when you're talking about your midterm.
[01:02.720 --> 01:05.120]  But I'm not supposed to be recording.
[01:05.120 --> 01:06.600]  So I'll put it on.
[01:06.600 --> 01:08.040]  I'll say, you have a week.
[01:08.040 --> 01:08.920]  Look at it.
[01:08.920 --> 01:11.680]  And then I'll take off the recording so no one knows.
[01:11.680 --> 01:13.080]  All right.
[01:13.080 --> 01:14.720]  All right, so let's get right into it.
[01:14.720 --> 01:17.680]  So let's talk about the Paul Thorn effect.
[01:17.680 --> 01:20.480]  This is something you should definitely note.
[01:20.480 --> 01:23.480]  I know that there is a multiple choice question on this.
[01:23.480 --> 01:25.200]  So what is this effect?
[01:25.200 --> 01:32.080]  So this is when research participants change
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.200]  their behavior simply because they know that they know more.
[01:40.040 --> 01:43.160]  So it's not because of the experimental treatment, which
[01:43.160 --> 01:45.080]  you'll understand in a few minutes.
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.360]  It's just because they know that they're being studied.
[01:49.360 --> 01:53.680]  So they're going to change their behavior accordingly.
[01:53.680 --> 01:57.200]  So what this does is it highlights
[01:57.200 --> 02:01.400]  how psychological factors like feeling special or receiving
[02:01.400 --> 02:06.600]  attention, these can all influence results.
[02:06.600 --> 02:09.440]  And obviously, when it's influencing these results,
[02:09.440 --> 02:12.600]  these are not accurate results.
[02:12.600 --> 02:15.520]  These are not accurate conclusions
[02:15.520 --> 02:18.320]  about the effect of the independent variable.
[02:18.840 --> 02:21.720]  OK?
[02:21.720 --> 02:24.720]  So here's a particular study that I
[02:24.720 --> 02:26.040]  want you to think about.
[02:26.040 --> 02:27.640]  It was a workplace study.
[02:27.640 --> 02:30.400]  And it looked at a factory.
[02:30.400 --> 02:32.320]  And what the researchers wanted to do
[02:32.320 --> 02:37.880]  was they wanted to test whether increasing light would
[02:37.880 --> 02:39.800]  improve worker productivity.
[02:39.800 --> 02:43.000]  So these light bulbs, does it increase
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.480]  your worker productivity?
[02:45.480 --> 02:50.040]  So productivity did indeed increase.
[02:50.040 --> 02:52.680]  But surprisingly, it also went up
[02:52.680 --> 02:56.440]  when the lights were dimmed again.
[02:56.440 --> 03:00.360]  The real cause wasn't the lighting.
[03:00.360 --> 03:03.040]  It was actually the attention that workers
[03:03.040 --> 03:08.280]  were receiving from being part of that study.
[03:08.280 --> 03:10.400]  So they felt observed.
[03:10.400 --> 03:13.040]  They felt valued, which motivated
[03:13.040 --> 03:14.160]  them to perform better.
[03:14.160 --> 03:16.400]  So it wasn't the light.
[03:16.400 --> 03:18.600]  It was just the attention that they were receiving,
[03:18.600 --> 03:22.560]  as being participants in that particular study.
[03:22.560 --> 03:24.880]  So this actually demonstrates to us
[03:24.880 --> 03:30.240]  that the Hawthorne effect can actually take place.
[03:30.240 --> 03:37.920]  That how your study can in itself influence behavior,
[03:37.920 --> 03:42.120]  regardless of the actual experimental changes.
[03:42.120 --> 03:44.120]  So do we understand that?
[03:45.080 --> 03:45.920]  All right.
[03:45.920 --> 03:49.480]  Remember, the other way of doing research
[03:49.480 --> 03:52.480]  is using a correlational design.
[03:52.480 --> 03:56.840]  So what happens in a correlational design?
[03:56.840 --> 04:02.080]  So correlational research, these measures,
[04:02.080 --> 04:04.760]  they measure variables precisely.
[04:04.760 --> 04:06.640]  And they examine relationships.
[04:06.640 --> 04:10.840]  They examine associations between variables
[04:10.840 --> 04:17.400]  without introducing any sort of change in the research setting.
[04:17.400 --> 04:19.680]  So this kind of research actually
[04:19.680 --> 04:23.960]  tells us whether or not two variables are related.
[04:26.760 --> 04:28.120]  But it does not test.
[04:28.120 --> 04:30.520]  And this is the important thing that you have to know.
[04:30.520 --> 04:33.480]  It does not tell us whether or not
[04:33.480 --> 04:36.320]  there is a cause and effect put into place.
[04:36.320 --> 04:39.640]  And I will explain that in a few minutes.
[04:39.720 --> 04:43.800]  So it tells us whether or not two variables are associated.
[04:43.800 --> 04:45.760]  Are they related to one another?
[04:45.760 --> 04:48.840]  So stress and job satisfaction.
[04:48.840 --> 04:50.480]  Are they related?
[04:50.480 --> 04:52.360]  But it doesn't tell us cause and effect.
[04:52.360 --> 05:02.560]  What I mean by that is, does stress lead to job satisfaction or not?
[05:02.560 --> 05:03.640]  That's a distinction.
[05:03.640 --> 05:04.720]  They're related.
[05:04.720 --> 05:06.440]  But does one lead to another?
[05:07.440 --> 05:08.920]  OK.
[05:08.920 --> 05:12.920]  So there are several ways in which we can conduct correlational research.
[05:12.920 --> 05:17.480]  There is surveys and interviews, where we basically
[05:17.480 --> 05:22.200]  ask people directly about their experiences, their thoughts,
[05:22.200 --> 05:25.120]  their behaviors.
[05:25.120 --> 05:27.400]  But we can also use existing data.
[05:27.400 --> 05:30.520]  So this is things like records.
[05:30.520 --> 05:31.880]  Maybe it's reports.
[05:31.880 --> 05:35.360]  Maybe it's data sets that already exist.
[05:35.360 --> 05:39.000]  You can look into those as well to see patterns.
[05:39.000 --> 05:39.520]  OK?
[05:39.520 --> 05:40.720]  Does that make sense?
[05:40.720 --> 05:43.840]  Will you remember that distinction between correlational
[05:43.840 --> 05:46.320]  and experimental, which I'll tell you in a few minutes?
[05:46.320 --> 05:49.760]  But just remember with correlational, all you're doing
[05:49.760 --> 05:54.840]  is you're trying to establish a relationship or an association.
[05:54.840 --> 05:57.600]  Or maybe it's just to identify a pattern.
[05:57.600 --> 06:03.480]  What you're not doing is whether or not these two variables, what
[06:03.480 --> 06:04.280]  leads to what.
[06:04.280 --> 06:07.120]  So there's no cause and effect put into place.
[06:07.120 --> 06:09.440]  Does that make sense?
[06:09.440 --> 06:10.520]  Say yes or no.
[06:10.520 --> 06:11.080]  Yes.
[06:11.080 --> 06:11.600]  OK.
[06:11.600 --> 06:15.760]  Because my short answer, it has that.
[06:15.760 --> 06:16.680]  OK?
[06:16.680 --> 06:17.200]  All right.
[06:17.200 --> 06:19.840]  You have to remember that in order to apply it.
[06:19.840 --> 06:21.000]  OK.
[06:21.000 --> 06:21.520]  All right.
[06:21.520 --> 06:24.640]  Now let's talk about what happens in a correlational design.
[06:24.640 --> 06:25.160]  OK?
[06:25.160 --> 06:32.200]  So I think by now, or maybe you haven't, how many of us have taken stats?
[06:32.240 --> 06:35.840]  How many of us know what a correlation coefficient is?
[06:35.840 --> 06:37.320]  No one does.
[06:37.320 --> 06:37.840]  OK.
[06:37.840 --> 06:38.840]  Like a few hands.
[06:38.840 --> 06:39.680]  OK.
[06:39.680 --> 06:40.280]  All right.
[06:40.280 --> 06:44.640]  So a correlation coefficient is abbreviated as R,
[06:44.640 --> 06:46.960]  like that small symbol R. Right?
[06:46.960 --> 06:49.800]  It describes the statistical relationship
[06:49.800 --> 06:51.720]  between two variables.
[06:51.720 --> 06:52.600]  OK?
[06:52.600 --> 06:58.480]  And it can range from minus 1 to positive 1.
[06:58.480 --> 06:59.560]  OK?
[06:59.560 --> 07:05.040]  What a correlation coefficient does is it tells us the direction as well
[07:05.040 --> 07:09.000]  as the strength of the relationship.
[07:09.000 --> 07:09.720]  OK?
[07:09.720 --> 07:15.920]  So direction has to do with whether or not it's positive or negative.
[07:15.920 --> 07:17.360]  OK?

[07:17.360 --> 07:25.400]  Minus 1 refers to a perfectly negative relationship.
[07:25.400 --> 07:30.840]  And a positive 1 refers to a perfectly positive relationship.
[07:30.840 --> 07:31.360]  OK?
[07:31.360 --> 07:33.280]  So that's the first thing you have to remember,
[07:33.280 --> 07:35.600]  that the correlation coefficient tells us
[07:35.600 --> 07:37.880]  the direction of that relationship.
[07:37.880 --> 07:41.480]  Is it positive or is it negative?
[07:41.480 --> 07:42.800]  OK?
[07:42.800 --> 07:44.880]  Minus 1, perfectly negative.
[07:44.880 --> 07:48.880]  Minus a positive 1, perfectly positive.
[07:48.880 --> 07:52.160]  And then 0, if you get the numerical value of 0,
[07:52.160 --> 07:56.640]  that means there's no statistical relationship.
[07:56.640 --> 07:57.640]  OK?
[07:57.640 --> 08:00.840]  So let me explain this using an example.
[08:00.840 --> 08:03.600]  What is meant by a positive correlation?
[08:03.600 --> 08:11.400]  A positive correlation basically means that when you increase on one variable,
[08:11.400 --> 08:17.880]  increase a unit on one variable, it is associated with an increase
[08:17.880 --> 08:21.120]  in another variable.
[08:21.120 --> 08:21.620]  OK?
[08:22.640 --> 08:25.320]  So here's the thing.
[08:25.320 --> 08:33.080]  Let's take a attendance in class, right, and your grade on the midterm.
[08:36.040 --> 08:36.520]  OK?
[08:36.520 --> 08:39.360]  If we were to use a correlational design,
[08:39.360 --> 08:43.520]  we would basically be seeing the association between the two.
[08:43.520 --> 08:46.000]  We're not really seeing cause and effect.
[08:46.000 --> 08:47.800]  We're just seeing, are they related?
[08:47.800 --> 08:49.400]  Are they associated?
[08:49.400 --> 08:50.200]  OK?
[08:50.200 --> 08:56.080]  Attendance in class with grade on the midterm.
[08:56.080 --> 09:00.120]  So this is what a positive relationship is.
[09:00.120 --> 09:06.920]  The more you attend in class, so you're seeing an increase on one variable,
[09:06.920 --> 09:09.520]  the greater your grade will be on the midterm.
[09:09.520 --> 09:12.600]  You're seeing an increase on the other variable.
[09:12.600 --> 09:16.040]  These are associated with one another.
[09:16.040 --> 09:17.640]  Does that make sense?
[09:17.640 --> 09:22.160]  A negative one would be you see an increase on one,
[09:22.160 --> 09:26.160]  and that's associated with a decrease on the other.
[09:26.160 --> 09:30.680]  So the more you attend class, the less likely
[09:30.680 --> 09:32.600]  you are to do well on the midterm.
[09:32.600 --> 09:34.200]  That sounds pretty weird, right?
[09:34.200 --> 09:36.840]  But it can happen.
[09:36.840 --> 09:38.040]  It's an association.
[09:38.040 --> 09:39.200]  Just a minute.
[09:39.200 --> 09:40.560]  It's an association.
[09:40.560 --> 09:43.200]  It doesn't mean that it's cause and effect.
[09:43.200 --> 09:46.800]  What that means is there's no way for me to know.
[09:46.800 --> 09:48.080]  There's no research.
[09:48.080 --> 09:49.360]  I mean, it's hypothetical.
[09:49.360 --> 09:50.600]  There is research for this.
[09:50.600 --> 09:53.040]  But it's hypothetical.
[09:53.040 --> 09:58.040]  There's no way for me to know that attending class will lead you
[09:58.040 --> 10:01.400]  to have an A plus in on the midterm.
[10:01.400 --> 10:02.560]  Does that make sense?
[10:02.560 --> 10:06.480]  That's what an experiment does, not a correlational design.
[10:06.480 --> 10:07.360]  Yes?
[10:07.360 --> 10:11.800]  So just to make sure that a positive correlation is when,
[10:11.840 --> 10:17.960]  let's say, an increase in x causes an increase in y.
[10:17.960 --> 10:19.520]  Not causes an increase.
[10:19.520 --> 10:20.520]  It's associated.
[10:20.520 --> 10:21.160]  Associated.
[10:21.160 --> 10:23.840]  So what's the difference between associated and it causes?
[10:23.840 --> 10:27.040]  Causes is it leads to something.
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.160]  Associated is you don't know if it leads to it.
[10:30.160 --> 10:31.840]  It's just associated.
[10:31.840 --> 10:33.920]  Just statistically.
[10:33.920 --> 10:36.000]  Yeah, statistically, even just we
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.680]  don't have any experimental design put into place.
[10:38.680 --> 10:41.360]  So we don't really know if it leads to one thing.
[10:41.400 --> 10:43.000]  We just know they're associated.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.600]  And then for a negative correlation,
[10:45.600 --> 10:47.400]  if x increases, y decreases.
[10:47.400 --> 10:47.920]  Yes.
[10:47.920 --> 10:48.480]  Statistically.
[10:48.480 --> 10:50.040]  Yes.
[10:50.040 --> 10:53.160]  If x increases, y decreases.
[10:53.160 --> 10:54.200]  They're associated.
[10:54.200 --> 10:55.600]  Does that make sense?
[10:55.600 --> 10:56.160]  Good.
[10:56.160 --> 10:56.680]  OK.
[10:56.680 --> 10:59.080]  So that's the direction.
[10:59.080 --> 11:01.160]  Now let's talk about the strength.
[11:01.160 --> 11:04.400]  The strength of a correlation is inferred
[11:04.400 --> 11:08.800]  from judging how compact something is on a scatter plot.
[11:09.800 --> 11:11.280]  OK.
[11:11.280 --> 11:14.360]  When it comes to the x and y values.
[11:14.360 --> 11:17.800]  The more compact it is, the stronger
[11:17.800 --> 11:20.080]  the correlation would be.
[11:20.080 --> 11:20.760]  OK.
[11:20.760 --> 11:23.840]  The less compact it is, the weaker the correlation
[11:23.840 --> 11:25.600]  it would be.
[11:25.600 --> 11:27.840]  So here are some.
[11:27.840 --> 11:28.720]  OK.
[11:28.720 --> 11:30.200]  So correlation.
[11:30.200 --> 11:32.240]  Let me just test you on this.
[11:32.240 --> 11:32.920]  OK.
[11:32.920 --> 11:36.160]  So r is the correlation coefficient.
[11:36.160 --> 11:38.280]  Here, do we have any correlation?
[11:38.280 --> 11:40.480]  Let's talk about direction first.
[11:40.480 --> 11:41.400]  Look at the values.
[11:41.400 --> 11:46.080]  r equals 0, r equals 70, r equals minus 70.
[11:46.080 --> 11:50.000]  So in the first case, when it comes to the two variables,
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.120]  draw satisfaction and draw performance,
[11:52.120 --> 11:54.240]  are they associated with one another?
[11:54.240 --> 11:55.880]  Yes or no?
[11:55.880 --> 11:56.360]  No.
[11:56.360 --> 11:56.880]  Good.
[11:56.880 --> 11:58.240]  Why?
[11:58.240 --> 12:00.880]  Who wants to take a stab?
[12:00.880 --> 12:01.640]  Yes.
[12:01.640 --> 12:02.920]  Looking at the coefficient alone,
[12:02.920 --> 12:04.560]  0 means there's no thing.
[12:04.560 --> 12:05.200]  Exactly.
[12:05.200 --> 12:06.280]  There's no association.
[12:09.280 --> 12:10.760]  No.
[12:10.760 --> 12:12.240]  It starts with a, right?
[12:12.240 --> 12:13.240]  Anthony.
[12:13.240 --> 12:14.240]  No.
[12:14.240 --> 12:15.720]  Double A.
[12:15.720 --> 12:16.480]  Aiden.
[12:16.480 --> 12:17.960]  No.
[12:17.960 --> 12:18.960]  Aaron.
[12:18.960 --> 12:19.480]  Aaron.
[12:19.480 --> 12:20.560]  OK.
[12:20.560 --> 12:21.400]  All right.
[12:21.400 --> 12:22.200]  OK.
[12:22.200 --> 12:23.280]  OK, good, Aaron.
[12:23.280 --> 12:26.960]  OK, how about r equals 70?
[12:26.960 --> 12:29.640]  First of all, is there an association?
[12:29.640 --> 12:30.120]  Jenny.
[12:30.120 --> 12:30.800]  Jenny, right?
[12:30.800 --> 12:31.480]  Yes.
[12:31.480 --> 12:33.480]  Is it a positive or a negative?
[12:33.480 --> 12:35.000]  Why is it positive?
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.680]  Well, in the numbers.
[12:36.680 --> 12:37.400]  Good.
[12:37.560 --> 12:38.480]  Yeah, that's it.
[12:38.480 --> 12:40.080]  That's all you need to know.
[12:40.080 --> 12:40.600]  Right?
[12:40.600 --> 12:41.480]  Like, that's it.
[12:41.480 --> 12:42.040]  OK.
[12:42.040 --> 12:44.840]  How about r equals my own?
[12:44.840 --> 12:46.280]  Like, scream there.
[12:46.280 --> 12:49.040]  r equals minus 70.
[12:52.560 --> 12:53.800]  Adeny.
[12:53.800 --> 12:54.400]  Adeny?
[12:54.400 --> 12:55.000]  Adeny.
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.400]  Adeny, yes.
[12:56.400 --> 12:57.840]  There's a negative coefficient.
100.117.97.99 - - [15/Sep/2025 22:00:24] "POST /transcripts/9/move HTTP/1.1" 200 -

100.117.97.99 - - [15/Sep/2025 22:00:34] "GET /history HTTP/1.1" 200 -
[12:57.840 --> 12:58.360]  Negative.
[12:58.360 --> 12:59.720]  Why?
[12:59.720 --> 13:01.800]  Well, the coefficient's negative.
[13:01.800 --> 13:02.640]  Exactly.
[13:02.640 --> 13:03.120]  Right?
[13:03.120 --> 13:03.720]  It's negative.
[13:03.720 --> 13:04.000]  OK.
[13:04.000 --> 13:04.640]  So that's that.
[13:04.640 --> 13:05.160]  So good.
[13:05.160 --> 13:06.520]  We understand the direction.
[13:06.600 --> 13:09.160]  Now let's look at the compactness.
[13:09.160 --> 13:11.000]  Remember what I said, the strength.
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.520]  It refers to how compact the numbers are.
[13:15.520 --> 13:16.240]  OK?
[13:16.240 --> 13:23.200]  So the more compact they are, the stronger it is.
[13:23.200 --> 13:27.200]  The weaker it is, the less compact it is, the weaker it is.
[13:27.200 --> 13:30.800]  So here is that strength of it.
[13:30.800 --> 13:31.800]  What do you think?
[13:34.800 --> 13:35.320]  Sweet.
[13:35.320 --> 13:36.480]  This is all we're going to say.
[13:36.480 --> 13:37.440]  No correlation.
[13:37.440 --> 13:39.000]  Why would you even give?
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.960]  How about with these two?
[13:40.960 --> 13:42.080]  They're almost the same.
[13:42.080 --> 13:42.560]  Yes?
[13:42.560 --> 13:44.760]  Um, numbers.
[13:44.760 --> 13:45.600]  Exactly.
[13:45.600 --> 13:46.080]  Right?
[13:46.080 --> 13:46.880]  That's it.
[13:46.880 --> 13:48.640]  That's all you're going to need to know.
[13:48.640 --> 13:50.000]  But there isn't a test.
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.600]  On the test, there isn't a question
[13:51.600 --> 13:53.440]  where it's asking you about the strength of it.
[13:53.440 --> 13:54.080]  So you don't really need to.
[13:54.080 --> 13:54.920]  It's so easy.
[13:54.920 --> 13:56.960]  I did such a good job of dumbing it down for you,
[13:56.960 --> 13:58.160]  but it's not on it.
[13:58.160 --> 13:58.800]  OK?
[13:58.800 --> 13:59.920]  But know that.
[13:59.920 --> 14:00.640]  OK?
[14:00.640 --> 14:01.880]  All right.
[14:01.880 --> 14:02.600]  Good.
[14:02.600 --> 14:08.480]  Now, let's talk about how the correlations should be.
[14:08.480 --> 14:09.120]  OK?
[14:09.120 --> 14:11.960]  So here are some correlations.
[14:11.960 --> 14:14.480]  Height and weight.
[14:14.480 --> 14:17.600]  Is it positively or negatively correlated?
[14:17.600 --> 14:20.120]  r equals 0.44.
[14:20.120 --> 14:20.840]  Positive.
[14:20.840 --> 14:21.640]  OK.
[14:21.640 --> 14:25.600]  Is it as close to plus 1?
[14:25.600 --> 14:26.480]  No.
[14:26.480 --> 14:28.960]  So is it a perfect one?
[14:28.960 --> 14:29.960]  OK.
[14:29.960 --> 14:33.480]  How about smoking and lung cancer within 25?
[14:33.480 --> 14:36.840]  Is it positive or negative?
[14:36.840 --> 14:38.080]  Positive.
[14:38.080 --> 14:40.400]  Closer to 1?
[14:40.400 --> 14:40.960]  No.
[14:40.960 --> 14:42.000]  Right?
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.040]  Closer to 0.1?
[14:43.040 --> 14:43.320]  No.
[14:43.320 --> 14:44.000]  OK.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.320]  So you're probably wondering, like, well, OK,
[14:46.320 --> 14:48.920]  how do I go about assessing this?
[14:48.920 --> 14:49.400]  Right?
[14:49.400 --> 14:50.680]  Like, how do I deal with this?
[14:50.680 --> 14:52.640]  So the general rule of thumb when
[14:52.640 --> 14:56.000]  it comes to evaluating the size of correlation
[14:56.040 --> 14:58.400]  is basically what's written on the slide.
[14:58.400 --> 15:00.120]  OK?
[15:00.120 --> 15:06.680]  To get a perfect 1, or to get a perfect minus 1,
[15:06.680 --> 15:08.680]  is going to be so rare.
[15:08.680 --> 15:10.720]  It's going to be very, very rare.
[15:10.720 --> 15:13.400]  If you get something like that you see in a journal article,
[15:13.400 --> 15:16.600]  you can for sure go and do some research
[15:16.600 --> 15:18.720]  and find out if it's being fabricated or not.
[15:18.720 --> 15:20.240]  OK?
[15:20.240 --> 15:21.040]  For sure.
[15:21.040 --> 15:22.240]  It's rare.
[15:22.240 --> 15:24.520]  It's rare to get perfect 1 or minus 1.
[15:24.520 --> 15:25.280]  Yes?
[15:25.280 --> 15:27.400]  I was just wondering if there is anything
[15:27.400 --> 15:29.880]  that is typically more complex.
[15:29.880 --> 15:31.960]  There isn't, because there are other variables that
[15:31.960 --> 15:32.760]  go into place.
[15:32.760 --> 15:33.880]  So there isn't.
[15:33.880 --> 15:34.560]  OK?
[15:34.560 --> 15:35.880]  So what is our general rule?
[15:35.880 --> 15:38.480]  As scholars, what is it that we do?
[15:38.480 --> 15:43.640]  We say that if it's close to 0.50, right,
[15:43.640 --> 15:45.280]  whether it's positive or negative,
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.000]  it doesn't matter, it's considered to be strong.
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.960]  0.30, considered to be moderate.
[15:51.960 --> 15:54.840]  0.10, considered to be weak.
[15:54.880 --> 15:56.960]  But there's still correlations, right?
[15:56.960 --> 15:59.280]  There's still some association.
[15:59.280 --> 16:03.240]  So even weak correlations will be there.
[16:03.240 --> 16:06.600]  And they're actually very, I would say,
[16:06.600 --> 16:10.240]  in the realm of OVHR, they are very important,
[16:10.240 --> 16:12.040]  because they will, and you will learn this
[16:12.040 --> 16:13.880]  as you take more courses, hopefully,
[16:13.880 --> 16:16.040]  in this particular domain, that they
[16:16.040 --> 16:19.560]  could lead to costly behaviors and important outcomes.
[16:19.560 --> 16:20.360]  OK?
[16:20.360 --> 16:25.840]  But anyway, so let's now talk about correlation
[16:25.840 --> 16:27.440]  in a little bit more detail.
[16:27.440 --> 16:28.080]  OK?
[16:28.080 --> 16:30.160]  This I feel like you should definitely know.
[16:30.160 --> 16:34.360]  So correlation only tells us if there is a relationship
[16:34.360 --> 16:39.920]  or if there is an association between two variables.
[16:39.920 --> 16:42.800]  It tells you the direction of that relationship.
[16:42.800 --> 16:45.560]  It tells you the strength of that relationship.
[16:45.560 --> 16:51.680]  What it doesn't tell us is why that association exists.
[16:51.680 --> 16:57.880]  It does not tell us what causes what, what leads to what.
[16:57.880 --> 17:01.560]  So correlation is not enough to prove causation.
[17:05.160 --> 17:08.200]  So causation would be why does it exist
[17:08.200 --> 17:11.440]  and what leads to what.
[17:11.440 --> 17:15.160]  So making causal inferences requires
[17:15.160 --> 17:18.320]  ruling out alternative explanations, which you cannot
[17:18.320 --> 17:21.960]  do with a correlational design.
[17:21.960 --> 17:23.760]  So what comes into play here?
[17:23.760 --> 17:26.040]  Experimental designs.
[17:26.040 --> 17:26.880]  OK?
[17:26.880 --> 17:28.680]  They're used for that purpose.
[17:28.680 --> 17:30.680]  What happens in an experiment?
[17:30.680 --> 17:33.080]  Well, you'll learn about that in a week from today.
[17:33.080 --> 17:36.680]  But what happens is you control things.
[17:36.680 --> 17:37.440]  OK?
[17:37.440 --> 17:40.200]  You control factors that could actually
[17:40.200 --> 17:44.960]  create misleading correlations.
[17:44.960 --> 17:46.200]  OK?
[17:46.200 --> 17:48.600]  Let's take this as an example.
[17:48.600 --> 17:52.680]  You attended class, right?
[17:52.680 --> 17:54.360]  Getting a good grade.
[17:54.360 --> 17:56.640]  But what are some other things that might result
[17:56.640 --> 17:59.960]  in you getting a good grade?
[17:59.960 --> 18:01.240]  Studying for more hours.
[18:01.240 --> 18:02.440]  You study more hours.
[18:02.440 --> 18:04.640]  So that would be a reason why, right?
[18:04.640 --> 18:05.840]  What else?
[18:05.840 --> 18:06.600]  Who else wants to?
[18:06.600 --> 18:11.320]  You do the practice exams, right?
[18:11.320 --> 18:13.040]  OK, good.
[18:13.040 --> 18:14.240]  What else?
[18:14.240 --> 18:15.840]  You're taking notes in the lectures?
[18:15.840 --> 18:16.720]  You're taking notes.
[18:16.720 --> 18:18.320]  So there are a couple of different things
[18:18.320 --> 18:20.760]  that could go into place, right?
[18:20.760 --> 18:23.760]  Here are some other things that might have an effect.
[18:23.760 --> 18:24.680]  Maybe it's your race.
[18:24.680 --> 18:27.400]  So there's research that indicate
[18:27.400 --> 18:33.320]  that certain races are at a disadvantage for certain tests.
[18:33.320 --> 18:36.200]  Cognitive ability tests, you see certain races
[18:36.200 --> 18:38.120]  not doing well in them.
[18:38.120 --> 18:40.680]  There's an ample research to indicate that.
[18:40.680 --> 18:43.640]  So what I'm trying to say is that there are other factors
[18:43.640 --> 18:46.200]  that will be going to affect, but they are not
[18:46.200 --> 18:48.520]  measured at this stage.
[18:48.520 --> 18:50.160]  Does that make sense?
[18:50.160 --> 18:53.880]  So correlation does not equal causation.
[18:53.880 --> 18:57.080]  And that is something you need to drill in your head.
[18:57.080 --> 19:01.360]  Because that is the thing that is the key in the question
[19:01.360 --> 19:03.320]  that I will ask you.
[19:03.320 --> 19:04.240]  OK?
[19:04.240 --> 19:04.840]  Good.
[19:04.840 --> 19:05.480]  All right.
[19:05.480 --> 19:10.440]  So experimental design comes into place.
[19:10.440 --> 19:11.920]  I'm curious about this comment.
[19:11.920 --> 19:15.120]  I don't want to spend too much.
[19:15.120 --> 19:16.760]  Should I give you this example?
[19:16.760 --> 19:19.440]  OK, let's give this correlational research
[19:19.440 --> 19:20.760]  an example.
[19:20.760 --> 19:23.240]  OK, so here's the hypothesis.
[19:23.240 --> 19:25.720]  Employees who perceive their supervisors
[19:25.720 --> 19:29.920]  as friendly and considerate will be more productive
[19:29.920 --> 19:34.080]  than those who perceive their supervisors as unfriendly
[19:34.080 --> 19:36.280]  and inconsiderate.
[19:36.280 --> 19:37.000]  OK?
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.960]  So how can you go about testing this?
[19:38.960 --> 19:40.560]  Well, you can use a service.
[19:40.560 --> 19:45.840]  You can just ask people to talk about their supervisor.
[19:45.840 --> 19:46.840]  Are they friendly?
[19:46.840 --> 19:48.520]  Are they considerate?
[19:48.520 --> 19:51.600]  And then you can ask them how productive you
[19:51.600 --> 19:53.320]  feel and all that stuff.
[19:53.320 --> 19:54.680]  OK?
[19:54.680 --> 19:57.520]  So what do we find?
[19:57.520 --> 19:58.520]  OK?
[19:58.520 --> 20:03.920]  We find that it is correlated.
[20:03.920 --> 20:05.520]  Is it in a positive direction?
[20:05.520 --> 20:06.520]  What are your thoughts?
[20:06.520 --> 20:10.120]  It's planting upward, so it must be positive, right?
[20:10.120 --> 20:11.600]  What is the strength?
[20:11.600 --> 20:13.880]  Do you think this is a compact one?
[20:13.880 --> 20:15.040]  Yes, right?
[20:15.040 --> 20:15.680]  It is.
[20:15.680 --> 20:16.440]  OK.
[20:16.440 --> 20:18.360]  Good.
[20:18.360 --> 20:21.960]  Now, based on what we know, right?
[20:21.960 --> 20:24.440]  So there's a lot of correlations between the supervisor
[20:24.440 --> 20:28.760]  being friendly, considerate, and worker productivity.
[20:28.760 --> 20:31.600]  Based on this study, shouldn't an organization
[20:31.600 --> 20:35.640]  attempt to select only the friendly supervisors
[20:35.640 --> 20:38.560]  or train existing supervisors to be friendly to obtain
[20:38.560 --> 20:39.600]  higher productivity?
[20:39.600 --> 20:41.960]  What are your thoughts?
[20:41.960 --> 20:42.480]  Yeah?
[20:42.480 --> 20:44.120]  No, because there might be something
[20:44.120 --> 20:46.360]  going on under the hood that we don't know about.
[20:46.360 --> 20:46.880]  OK.
[20:46.880 --> 20:48.320]  Maybe they have better training.
[20:48.320 --> 20:48.880]  OK.
[20:48.880 --> 20:51.160]  And that leads them to perform better at their job
[20:51.160 --> 20:52.760]  instead of the supervisor being nice.
[20:52.760 --> 20:53.320]  Good.
[20:53.320 --> 20:53.800]  OK.
[20:53.800 --> 20:54.800]  What is your name?
[20:54.800 --> 20:55.440]  What's your name?
[20:55.440 --> 20:55.960]  My name?
[20:55.960 --> 20:56.880]  Eris.
[20:56.880 --> 20:57.400]  Eris.
[20:57.400 --> 20:57.960]  OK.
[20:57.960 --> 20:58.440]  Good.
[20:58.440 --> 21:00.520]  Anyone else have a point to add to that?
[21:00.520 --> 21:02.680]  Or maybe it's a different explanation.
[21:02.680 --> 21:05.600]  So maybe it's the training that they received.
[21:05.600 --> 21:07.080]  You haven't participated yet.
[21:07.080 --> 21:09.000]  Oh, yeah.
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.400]  It was very similar to that.
[21:11.400 --> 21:13.480]  No.
[21:13.480 --> 21:14.360]  Should I just tell you?
[21:14.360 --> 21:15.120]  Jaspreet.
[21:15.120 --> 21:16.160]  Jaspreet.
[21:16.160 --> 21:17.000]  Yeah.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.640]  So I mean, the friendly supervisors
[21:20.640 --> 21:22.880]  exist because they had unfriendly supervisors
[21:22.880 --> 21:23.960]  in the first place, maybe.
[21:23.960 --> 21:24.960]  OK, sure.
[21:24.960 --> 21:29.360]  Yeah, because maybe in the first place,
[21:29.360 --> 21:31.000]  they experience the unfriendly supervisor.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.240]  That's why they're like, oh, let me just be friendly.
[21:33.240 --> 21:35.200]  Yeah, so they might make a conscious effort
[21:35.200 --> 21:38.000]  to be friendly just because of their past experiences.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.760]  OK, sure.
[21:39.760 --> 21:40.400]  All right.
[21:40.400 --> 21:42.880]  OK.
[21:42.880 --> 21:43.880]  All right, go on.
[21:43.880 --> 21:46.000]  So the way that the study was conducted,
[21:46.000 --> 21:47.000]  Jaspreet started that.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.480]  And so the employees could have maybe influenced them a lot.
[21:50.480 --> 21:51.880]  Exactly, right?
[21:51.880 --> 21:56.120]  The employees, maybe they responded in such a way
[21:56.120 --> 22:02.080]  where it was not fabricated, but they exaggerated, right?
[22:02.080 --> 22:03.960]  Because maybe, who knows?
[22:03.960 --> 22:05.920]  They felt like their supervisor might be it,
[22:05.920 --> 22:07.120]  or whatever the case may be.
[22:07.120 --> 22:08.920]  OK, sure.
[22:08.920 --> 22:11.760]  If it's not a clear definition of what
[22:11.760 --> 22:14.440]  it means to be friendly, they might become too lenient.
[22:14.440 --> 22:16.880]  And they might drop productivity because they'll be like, oh,
[22:16.880 --> 22:17.360]  do whatever.
[22:17.360 --> 22:18.360]  Exactly, right?
[22:18.360 --> 22:19.680]  So again, it comes down.
[22:19.680 --> 22:21.600]  So as you can see, there's several.
[22:21.600 --> 22:25.000]  We can say this with affirmation.
[22:25.000 --> 22:31.760]  Yes, friendly supervisors will lead to productive workers.
[22:31.760 --> 22:33.080]  We simply can't.
[22:33.080 --> 22:36.040]  So that's where causation comes in.
[22:36.040 --> 22:36.760]  OK?
[22:36.760 --> 22:39.960]  So here, we cannot infer causation.
[22:39.960 --> 22:43.240]  We know they're associated, but there are other factors
[22:43.240 --> 22:46.440]  that might be playing, right?
[22:46.440 --> 22:51.160]  So the answer to that question is basically no.
[22:51.160 --> 22:51.680]  Why?
[22:51.680 --> 22:54.040]  Because the relationship is correlational,
[22:54.040 --> 22:57.320]  is not causal.
[22:57.320 --> 23:01.720]  Supervisors might be friendly if their employees are productive.
[23:01.720 --> 23:03.760]  We didn't consider that, right?
[23:03.760 --> 23:08.080]  So if all of you get A's in my class,
[23:08.080 --> 23:11.000]  I might be friendly as a result because of that.
[23:11.000 --> 23:12.520]  So it might be the other way around.
[23:12.520 --> 23:14.200]  Does that make sense?
[23:14.200 --> 23:15.400]  Yeah.
[23:15.400 --> 23:19.120]  So this is where a third variable problem comes in,
[23:19.120 --> 23:22.480]  meaning that there might be other factors explaining
[23:22.480 --> 23:25.720]  that relationship.
[23:25.720 --> 23:27.280]  So here is one.
[23:27.280 --> 23:31.520]  It could be positive work environment.
[23:31.520 --> 23:33.040]  It could be that.
[23:33.040 --> 23:34.600]  It could be a number of other things
[23:34.600 --> 23:36.760]  that you've already discussed.
[23:36.760 --> 23:38.760]  OK?
[23:38.760 --> 23:41.720]  So that's what you see in red is very important.
[23:41.720 --> 23:45.280]  Correlation does not mean causation.
[23:45.280 --> 23:50.720]  So how can we find out which factors cause these behaviors?
[23:50.800 --> 23:53.000]  Well, this is where the experimental design
[23:53.000 --> 23:54.800]  comes into play.
[23:54.800 --> 23:55.960]  OK?
[23:55.960 --> 23:58.200]  So what happens in an experiment?
[23:58.200 --> 24:03.200]  An experiment is like a test where it's a trial.
[24:03.200 --> 24:03.960]  OK?
[24:03.960 --> 24:06.480]  What we're doing is we want to see what
[24:06.480 --> 24:09.960]  happens when we change something.
[24:09.960 --> 24:10.800]  OK?
[24:10.800 --> 24:14.280]  So imagine that you're baking cookies.
[24:14.280 --> 24:15.240]  OK?
[24:15.240 --> 24:19.440]  And you want to know if adding more sugar
[24:19.440 --> 24:20.720]  will make them taste better.
[24:24.240 --> 24:26.600]  So basically what you would do is this.
[24:26.600 --> 24:30.560]  You would bake two batches of cookies.
[24:30.560 --> 24:31.800]  Right?
[24:31.800 --> 24:35.880]  In one would be the usual amount of sugar.
[24:35.880 --> 24:40.600]  And in the other one, you added extra sugar.
[24:40.600 --> 24:45.160]  Then you would taste both, and you'd compare.
[24:45.160 --> 24:45.840]  OK?
[24:45.840 --> 24:48.240]  That's an experiment right there.
[24:48.240 --> 24:50.640]  Does that make sense?
[24:50.640 --> 24:53.680]  So we have two conditions basically, two or more
[24:53.680 --> 24:57.560]  conditions, where we have changed the thing
[24:57.560 --> 24:58.840]  to see if it leads to it.
[25:01.880 --> 25:02.480]  OK?
[25:02.480 --> 25:06.800]  So in science or organizational studies, it's the same thing.
[25:06.800 --> 25:08.680]  We change one thing.
[25:08.680 --> 25:10.360]  This is called a variable.
[25:10.360 --> 25:11.160]  Right?
[25:11.160 --> 25:14.320]  We keep everything else the same.
[25:14.320 --> 25:16.960]  And then we see what happens.
[25:16.960 --> 25:17.920]  OK?
[25:17.960 --> 25:20.880]  We see if that change will make a difference.
[25:20.880 --> 25:22.600]  Will it lead to a different outcome?
[25:26.440 --> 25:29.800]  And this helps us figure out what causes what.
[25:29.800 --> 25:32.120]  Does that make sense?
[25:32.120 --> 25:33.640]  OK.
[25:33.640 --> 25:38.080]  So let's go back to that hypothesis of ours.
[25:38.080 --> 25:42.120]  Friendly supervision contributes to employee product.
[25:42.120 --> 25:42.880]  OK?
[25:42.880 --> 25:47.880]  So we want to find out if being supervised in a friendly way
[25:47.880 --> 25:51.320]  helps our employees work better, maybe become better
[25:51.320 --> 25:54.240]  productive, or be more productive.
[25:54.240 --> 25:54.880]  OK?
[25:54.880 --> 25:59.040]  So to test our hypothesis, which is basically
[25:59.040 --> 26:00.720]  like it said on the previous slide,
[26:00.720 --> 26:04.320]  friendly supervision contributes to employee productivity,
[26:04.320 --> 26:05.640]  we manipulate.
[26:05.640 --> 26:06.920]  That's a key thing here.
[26:06.920 --> 26:14.160]  We manipulate, or we change the level of friendliness
[26:14.160 --> 26:16.240]  in some supervisors.
[26:16.240 --> 26:16.880]  OK?
[26:16.880 --> 26:21.400]  So how might we be able to do that?
[26:21.400 --> 26:27.800]  Well, you could teach some supervisors to be considerate.
[26:27.800 --> 26:29.800]  You can teach them to be encouraging.
[26:29.800 --> 26:31.880]  You can teach them to be personable.
[26:31.880 --> 26:33.800]  It depends on your definition of friendliness,
[26:33.800 --> 26:36.080]  how you've defined it friendly.
[26:36.080 --> 26:38.200]  But you can teach some people to do that.
[26:41.760 --> 26:44.440]  And in the other condition, what you could do
[26:44.440 --> 26:48.480]  is you could just not teach them anything,
[26:48.480 --> 26:51.880]  or teach them the complete opposite.
[26:51.880 --> 26:55.600]  Teach them to be inconsiderate, not encouraging, not
[26:55.600 --> 26:57.440]  personable.
[26:57.440 --> 26:58.400]  OK?
[26:58.400 --> 27:02.880]  So then what we're going to do is there is a manipulation.
[27:02.880 --> 27:03.680]  There's a change.
[27:03.680 --> 27:07.840]  And we observe whether these employees become more productive.
[27:08.840 --> 27:12.040]  Compared to those who either didn't receive the training
[27:12.040 --> 27:14.520]  or who received the training in the opposite direction.
[27:14.520 --> 27:16.320]  Does that make sense?
[27:16.320 --> 27:21.360]  So that's the key thing with experimental design.
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.800]  Experimental design, you're manipulating something.
[27:26.800 --> 27:27.800]  OK?
[27:27.800 --> 27:30.760]  So if you want to test for something, your IV,
[27:30.760 --> 27:35.400]  you have two conditions to test your IV.
[27:36.000 --> 27:36.880]  To test your IV.
[27:39.600 --> 27:40.080]  OK?
[27:40.080 --> 27:41.720]  In one condition, you're actually
[27:41.720 --> 27:43.160]  doing what you want to set out.
[27:43.160 --> 27:45.640]  Like, if in this case it's friendly supervisor,
[27:45.640 --> 27:47.600]  train them to be friendly supervisor.
[27:47.600 --> 27:49.200]  And then in the other condition, you're
[27:49.200 --> 27:51.840]  doing the complete opposite, or they receive no training
[27:51.840 --> 27:54.360]  whatsoever.
[27:54.360 --> 27:58.360]  Usually, the best way is to give no training.
[27:58.360 --> 27:59.440]  Makes sense?
[27:59.440 --> 28:02.160]  And then you just see who's more productive.
[28:02.160 --> 28:07.840]  Is it those employees who receive the friendly training,
[28:07.840 --> 28:13.080]  or is it those who receive no training?
[28:13.080 --> 28:14.680]  Make sense?
[28:14.680 --> 28:16.440]  OK.
[28:16.440 --> 28:19.840]  So that's basically how you would go about doing this.
[28:23.360 --> 28:26.320]  Now, what is this particular graph showing you?
[28:27.320 --> 28:27.800]  OK.
[28:31.280 --> 28:33.280]  One of the questions that's often asked
[28:33.280 --> 28:37.200]  is, like, the friendly training, does it actually work?
[28:37.200 --> 28:37.920]  Right?
[28:37.920 --> 28:43.000]  Can we now confidently say that friendly supervisors lead
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.680]  to more productive employees?
[28:46.680 --> 28:50.880]  And it's not always necessarily the case.
[28:50.880 --> 28:52.480]  OK?
[28:52.480 --> 28:55.800]  Even if we see an increase in productivity,
[28:55.800 --> 28:59.520]  we can't be 100% sure that it was because
[28:59.520 --> 29:02.840]  of the friendly training.
[29:02.840 --> 29:07.440]  Maybe something else changed at the same time.
[29:07.440 --> 29:09.880]  Like, maybe new equipment was introduced,
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.800]  or maybe it was that the employees became more motivated,
[29:14.800 --> 29:18.200]  or maybe they're stressed because of, I don't know,
[29:18.200 --> 29:20.080]  maybe there are rumors of layoff.
[29:20.080 --> 29:21.400]  Who knows, right?
[29:21.400 --> 29:26.720]  So these are all called confounding errors.
[29:26.720 --> 29:30.240]  These are outside factors that might have influenced
[29:30.240 --> 29:34.720]  the result without us realizing it.
[29:34.720 --> 29:35.920]  OK?
[29:35.920 --> 29:40.960]  And so to control for that, we have a control group.
[29:40.960 --> 29:42.920]  What's a control group?
[29:42.920 --> 29:45.920]  Well, it's basically what I had described to you before.
[29:45.920 --> 29:49.000]  It's a group that was not exposed
[29:49.000 --> 29:53.680]  to the experimental treatment at all.
[29:53.680 --> 29:54.160]  OK?
[29:54.160 --> 29:56.200]  So in this case, it would be supervisors
[29:56.200 --> 29:58.200]  who didn't receive any sort of training.
[30:03.200 --> 30:05.280]  So why is this important?
[30:05.280 --> 30:10.280]  Why is it important to include a control group?
[30:10.280 --> 30:12.880]  It's important because in good experiment,
[30:12.880 --> 30:17.720]  we want to be confident that it's the treatment and just
[30:17.720 --> 30:19.920]  the treatment that caused the effect.
[30:24.320 --> 30:24.840]  OK?
[30:24.840 --> 30:26.840]  So that's why in a control group,
[30:26.840 --> 30:29.600]  we want everything to be the same, right?
[30:29.600 --> 30:33.280]  Like, we want the supervisors to be similar in age.
[30:33.280 --> 30:35.480]  We want them to have similar background.
[30:35.480 --> 30:39.280]  We want them to have similar experience.
[30:39.280 --> 30:41.560]  The only thing that should differ
[30:41.560 --> 30:44.240]  is the training that they received in one condition
[30:44.240 --> 30:45.640]  and in the other that they didn't.
[30:45.640 --> 30:49.760]  Because then you can say it with affirmation that, yes,
[30:49.760 --> 30:52.200]  it was the treatment that caused the effect.
[30:52.200 --> 30:54.320]  Does that make sense?
[30:54.320 --> 30:56.160]  So all else equal.
[30:56.160 --> 30:57.960]  That's why it led to that.
[30:57.960 --> 30:59.760]  So do we understand the difference
[30:59.760 --> 31:03.320]  between correlation and experimental?
[31:03.320 --> 31:07.480]  And do we understand how an experiment is conducted?
[31:07.480 --> 31:08.160]  Yes?
[31:08.160 --> 31:11.040]  Can I pick on someone to teach us how it stands?
[31:11.040 --> 31:12.680]  Because this is very important.
[31:12.680 --> 31:15.040]  So I want to, like, can I pick on someone?
[31:15.040 --> 31:16.360]  Who wants to volunteer?
[31:16.360 --> 31:16.840]  Yes, Simon?
[31:20.000 --> 31:23.200]  Basically, to conduct an experiment,
[31:23.200 --> 31:27.280]  you need a bunch of variables in one control group.
[31:27.280 --> 31:29.080]  Basically, what you want to do is
[31:29.080 --> 31:31.760]  you want to make sure that your environment is controlled.
[31:31.760 --> 31:32.480]  OK.
[31:32.480 --> 31:35.480]  Everything within the environment is the same.
[31:35.480 --> 31:37.120]  You have one thing to change.
[31:37.120 --> 31:37.600]  OK.
[31:37.600 --> 31:40.920]  So in the control group, you have a set base.
[31:40.920 --> 31:41.520]  Yes.
[31:41.520 --> 31:43.880]  And then in every other group, you change that base.
[31:43.880 --> 31:44.840]  OK.
[31:44.840 --> 31:45.340]  Good.
[31:45.340 --> 31:48.320]  And then you check the results of each group.
[31:48.320 --> 31:48.800]  Good.
[31:48.800 --> 31:49.280]  OK.
[31:49.280 --> 31:53.120]  But it won't be, on a test, it won't be like so many groups.
[31:53.120 --> 31:56.360]  It would just probably be like, just focus on this.
[31:56.360 --> 31:58.920]  There's two conditions, right?
[31:58.920 --> 32:01.680]  In one, you're manipulating.
[32:01.680 --> 32:03.720]  And in the other is a control.
[32:03.720 --> 32:04.200]  OK.
[32:04.200 --> 32:06.360]  And then what you explain is correct.
[32:06.360 --> 32:06.960]  OK.
[32:06.960 --> 32:09.880]  So in the control, you keep everything,
[32:09.880 --> 32:11.640]  basically everything stays the same.
[32:11.640 --> 32:13.120]  Everything stays the same.
[32:13.120 --> 32:15.800]  But in that one experimental treatment,
[32:15.800 --> 32:18.240]  you make that change that you're interested in.
[32:18.240 --> 32:21.280]  And then you look at the outcome.
[32:21.280 --> 32:22.760]  Make sense?
[32:22.760 --> 32:23.260]  OK.
[32:25.800 --> 32:26.320]  All right.
[32:26.320 --> 32:26.820]  Sorry.
[32:26.820 --> 32:28.280]  I already spoke about that.
[32:28.280 --> 32:28.780]  That's great.
[32:28.780 --> 32:29.280]  OK.
[32:29.280 --> 32:29.880]  Whatever.
[32:29.880 --> 32:30.380]  All right.
[32:30.380 --> 32:37.360]  Now let's talk about evaluating the quality of OB research.
[32:37.360 --> 32:39.040]  OK.
[32:39.040 --> 32:41.360]  The extent to which we don't actually
[32:41.360 --> 32:42.320]  provide the definition.
[32:42.320 --> 32:42.820]  Oh, I said it.
[32:42.820 --> 32:43.320]  Great.
[32:43.320 --> 32:43.820]  OK.
[32:43.820 --> 32:44.320]  Great.
[32:44.320 --> 32:44.820]  There we go.
[32:44.820 --> 32:45.320]  All right.
[32:45.320 --> 32:48.040]  The extent to which a researcher can
[32:48.040 --> 32:52.560]  be confident that changes in a dependent variable
[32:52.560 --> 32:56.000]  are due to the independent variable,
[32:56.000 --> 33:01.240]  and not by anything else, is known as internal validity.
[33:01.240 --> 33:03.040]  OK.
[33:03.040 --> 33:05.880]  In other words, what we're doing is we're actually
[33:05.880 --> 33:09.200]  asking ourselves, did the treatment really
[33:09.200 --> 33:12.040]  cause the effect?
[33:12.040 --> 33:13.040]  OK.
[33:13.040 --> 33:17.240]  And experiments usually tend to have higher internal validity.
[33:17.240 --> 33:18.560]  Why is that?
[33:18.560 --> 33:21.520]  Because the IV, the independent variable,
[33:21.520 --> 33:24.200]  is manipulated by the researcher.
[33:24.200 --> 33:25.160]  Right?
[33:25.160 --> 33:29.240]  There is strong control over other variables.
[33:29.240 --> 33:33.160]  And this is often, there is often a control group
[33:33.160 --> 33:35.120]  of comparison.
[33:35.120 --> 33:37.360]  OK.
[33:37.360 --> 33:41.040]  So this kind of setup, the experimental setup, what it
[33:41.040 --> 33:45.720]  does is it helps eliminate any of the confounding variables.
[33:45.720 --> 33:46.200]  OK.
[33:46.200 --> 33:48.600]  Other things that could have caused the outcome.
[33:52.080 --> 33:56.440]  We can be quite confident that the cause-effect relationship
[33:56.440 --> 33:58.880]  is real.
[33:58.880 --> 34:01.640]  So internal validity is really having
[34:01.640 --> 34:03.920]  to do with the experimental stuff.
[34:03.920 --> 34:06.640]  Did the treatment cause the effect?
[34:06.640 --> 34:07.640]  OK.
[34:07.640 --> 34:11.040]  The other one is known as external validity.
[34:11.040 --> 34:14.040]  External validity is all about whether the results
[34:14.040 --> 34:17.560]  of the study can be generalized or can
[34:17.560 --> 34:20.280]  be applied to the real world.
[34:20.280 --> 34:21.360]  OK.
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.120]  Real world, that means like other people, places, or times
[34:25.120 --> 34:28.040]  outside of the study.
[34:28.040 --> 34:30.040]  So basically, can we generalize these?
[34:30.040 --> 34:35.040]  And here's the thing.
[34:35.040 --> 34:38.440]  Correlational designs usually tend
[34:38.440 --> 34:45.320]  to have higher external validity and lower internal validity.
[34:45.320 --> 34:46.880]  Why?
[34:46.880 --> 34:57.600]  Why is it that correlations have higher external validity,
[34:57.600 --> 34:59.520]  lower internal validity?
[34:59.520 --> 35:01.520]  Well, there's a couple of different reasons.
[35:01.520 --> 35:05.920]  First, correlational, usually a survey or an interview
[35:05.920 --> 35:07.720]  that we've given to people.
[35:07.720 --> 35:14.240]  So they're often based on real world observations or surveys.
[35:14.240 --> 35:19.000]  They include naturally occurring variables,
[35:19.000 --> 35:20.160]  not manipulated ones.
[35:23.760 --> 35:28.320]  But having said that, since we can't really
[35:28.320 --> 35:31.080]  control or even randomly assign, which
[35:31.080 --> 35:32.920]  I'll talk about in a few minutes,
[35:32.920 --> 35:36.320]  we can't be sure what's causing what.
[35:36.320 --> 35:37.920]  OK?
[35:37.920 --> 35:40.600]  So does that make sense?
[35:40.600 --> 35:41.080]  Yes?
[35:41.080 --> 35:41.560]  No?
[35:44.920 --> 35:45.680]  All right.
[35:45.680 --> 35:50.040]  So in experiments, if there is no control group,
[35:50.040 --> 35:53.960]  internal validity would be low.
[35:53.960 --> 35:54.440]  Why?
[35:54.440 --> 35:59.000]  Because other factors might be explaining
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.960]  the dependent variable changes.
[36:01.960 --> 36:05.480]  In our case, it might be productivity.
[36:05.480 --> 36:07.880]  So what might these factors be?
[36:07.880 --> 36:09.440]  We've already discussed some.
[36:09.440 --> 36:13.360]  But maybe it's the selection of participants.
[36:13.360 --> 36:15.640]  So when participants, when they're
[36:15.640 --> 36:18.200]  selected for an experimental group,
[36:18.200 --> 36:21.480]  maybe they differ from those who are in the control group
[36:21.480 --> 36:23.440]  in some form or another.
[36:23.440 --> 36:25.760]  Maybe, I don't know.
[36:25.760 --> 36:27.560]  It could be a number of different things
[36:27.560 --> 36:32.040]  that could influence the experiment itself.
[36:32.040 --> 36:34.320]  Maybe it's the testing itself.
[36:34.320 --> 36:36.920]  Maybe the process of completing a survey
[36:36.920 --> 36:40.760]  and answering questions at the start of an experiment
[36:40.760 --> 36:45.920]  might sensitize participants to the study.
[36:45.920 --> 36:47.760]  It might influence how they respond
[36:47.760 --> 36:51.760]  to the questions after the experiment.
[36:51.760 --> 36:55.920]  So all in all, there might be a number of different factors
[36:55.920 --> 36:57.600]  that can go into it.
[36:57.600 --> 36:59.040]  And in order to address, in order
[36:59.040 --> 37:03.400]  to overcome the explanation of those different factors,
[37:03.400 --> 37:06.160]  we need to have a control group.
[37:06.160 --> 37:07.120]  Does that make sense?
[37:09.680 --> 37:10.200]  All right.
[37:10.200 --> 37:15.400]  So I already mentioned, here are some that you can make note of.
[37:15.400 --> 37:17.400]  OK, so we talked about that already.
[37:17.400 --> 37:19.320]  Let's talk about random sampling.
[37:19.360 --> 37:23.960]  So experimental studies use random sampling.
[37:23.960 --> 37:27.200]  In a well-designed experimental study,
[37:27.200 --> 37:32.000]  researchers often start with random sampling.
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.800]  So what this means is that they randomly
[37:35.800 --> 37:41.720]  choose participants from a larger population of interest.
[37:41.720 --> 37:43.480]  So by doing so, you're making sure
[37:43.480 --> 37:47.480]  that your sample is representative of the population
[37:47.640 --> 37:51.360]  that you're interested in, so that your results can
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.960]  be generalized beyond your own study.
[37:55.960 --> 37:59.520]  And of course, then, this will lead to external validity,
[37:59.520 --> 38:00.920]  which is, remember what it is.
[38:00.920 --> 38:05.200]  It's the ability to apply the findings to the real world.
[38:11.440 --> 38:16.200]  So in an experiment, how might random,
[38:16.560 --> 38:18.400]  so that's random sampling.
[38:18.400 --> 38:23.400]  So say I'm interested in university students.
[38:23.400 --> 38:26.880]  I'm interested in the same thing, my hypothesis,
[38:26.880 --> 38:31.680]  which would be, the more they attend class, the more likely
[38:31.680 --> 38:39.400]  they are to get an A on their test.
[38:39.400 --> 38:41.680]  So random sampling would be what?
[38:41.680 --> 38:44.000]  Which population should I be looking at, first of all?
[38:46.200 --> 38:47.200]  Students.
[38:47.200 --> 38:50.360]  Does it have to be from loop or Laurier?
[38:50.360 --> 38:53.200]  Doesn't have to be, but it can be,
[38:53.200 --> 38:55.400]  because you're students, much like every other.
[38:55.400 --> 38:57.160]  Should it be at the undergraduate level
[38:57.160 --> 38:58.880]  or master's level?
[38:58.880 --> 39:00.160]  What are your thoughts there?
[39:05.640 --> 39:07.560]  It depends on what I'm looking at.
[39:07.560 --> 39:09.560]  So if I'm saying undergrad, I should only
[39:09.560 --> 39:11.440]  be focusing my attention on undergrad, right?
[39:11.440 --> 39:13.880]  So it needs to be a little bit more specific.
[39:13.880 --> 39:15.880]  But that's what random sampling is,
[39:15.880 --> 39:18.040]  is to make sure you know your population
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.080]  and then to randomly select one.
[39:22.080 --> 39:26.960]  So I could send out a survey to almost all the universities
[39:26.960 --> 39:30.760]  and be like, I'm looking for second year
[39:30.760 --> 39:35.320]  organizational behavior students to complete my survey.
[39:35.320 --> 39:36.400]  That's it.
[39:36.400 --> 39:38.680]  That's random sampling.
[39:38.680 --> 39:44.200]  What happens after random sampling is random assignment.
[39:44.200 --> 39:46.040]  I don't think I mentioned that on this slide.
[39:46.040 --> 39:46.520]  No, I didn't.
[39:46.520 --> 39:47.760]  So note this down.
[39:47.760 --> 39:51.600]  So what happens is random assignment.
[39:51.600 --> 39:56.000]  So once you have selected your sample,
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.520]  the next important step is to randomly assign
[40:00.520 --> 40:04.520]  the participants to the groups.
[40:04.520 --> 40:07.160]  So you're randomly assigning them to the different groups.
[40:07.160 --> 40:08.880]  What are the two different groups?
[40:08.880 --> 40:13.200]  What are they called in an experiment?
[40:13.200 --> 40:14.400]  One is the?
[40:14.400 --> 40:14.880]  Control.
[40:14.880 --> 40:16.000]  Control.
[40:16.000 --> 40:16.920]  Control, good.
[40:16.920 --> 40:18.400]  The other one would be?
[40:18.400 --> 40:20.520]  Experimental.
[40:20.520 --> 40:24.800]  Experimental, treatments, manipulation, any of those.
[40:24.800 --> 40:25.840]  Any of those names.
[40:25.840 --> 40:27.520]  OK, makes sense?
[40:27.520 --> 40:28.720]  OK, good.
[40:28.720 --> 40:30.480]  So you randomly assign them.
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.200]  So remember, the experimental, manipulation, the treatment
[40:38.200 --> 40:42.120]  group, it receives the manipulation,
[40:42.120 --> 40:44.160]  the intervention.
[40:44.160 --> 40:47.160]  The control group does not receive it.
[40:47.160 --> 40:50.080]  So let me tell you what that means.
[40:50.080 --> 40:51.880]  So random assignment.
[40:51.880 --> 40:55.840]  So I now have conducted an experiment.
[40:55.840 --> 40:57.960]  This is my random class.
[40:57.960 --> 40:59.120]  It's a conflict of interest.
[40:59.120 --> 41:00.200]  But whatever.
[41:00.200 --> 41:02.800]  So this is my class.
[41:02.800 --> 41:05.480]  Randomly sampling this particular class.
[41:05.480 --> 41:09.240]  I want to see if you coming in for every class
[41:09.240 --> 41:13.880]  will result in a greater grade.
[41:13.880 --> 41:15.320]  That's my hypothesis.
[41:15.320 --> 41:17.960]  The more you attend class, the better your grade
[41:17.960 --> 41:19.920]  would be in the test.
[41:19.920 --> 41:21.760]  So how would I go about testing this?
[41:21.760 --> 41:23.440]  How about someone take a stab at this?
[41:23.440 --> 41:27.200]  Tell me how you would do this in an experimental class.
[41:27.200 --> 41:28.360]  Yes.
[41:28.360 --> 41:31.840]  I mean, for the control group, you could just let them be.
[41:31.840 --> 41:34.560]  And for the experimental group, we
[41:34.560 --> 41:36.560]  could offer them an incentive.
[41:36.560 --> 41:38.960]  Maybe give them a bonus mark for coming to class.
[41:38.960 --> 41:40.240]  Or like, you know.
[41:40.240 --> 41:40.840]  Yeah.
[41:40.840 --> 41:41.880]  You don't have to do that.
[41:41.880 --> 41:42.560]  It's a very safe.
[41:42.560 --> 41:43.200]  But you're good.
[41:43.200 --> 41:43.680]  OK.
[41:43.680 --> 41:46.560]  So the control group, let them be.
[41:46.560 --> 41:47.400]  Who wants to come?
[41:47.400 --> 41:48.280]  Who doesn't?
[41:48.280 --> 41:50.920]  For the other one, you make it mandatory for them
[41:50.920 --> 41:52.520]  to come to every class.
[41:52.520 --> 41:55.800]  It doesn't have to be associated with a bonus or anything.
[41:55.800 --> 41:58.320]  Do you see the difference between the two?
[41:58.320 --> 41:59.640]  Control is good.
[41:59.640 --> 42:00.920]  Let them be.
[42:00.920 --> 42:02.440]  Some people will show up for class.
[42:02.440 --> 42:03.840]  Some won't.
[42:03.840 --> 42:04.680]  It depends.
[42:04.680 --> 42:06.040]  Who cares?
[42:06.040 --> 42:08.360]  Other ones, you say to them, you need
[42:08.360 --> 42:10.120]  to show up for every class.
[42:10.120 --> 42:11.080]  So good.
[42:11.080 --> 42:12.960]  So we have an experimental group,
[42:12.960 --> 42:14.960]  which is like, come up for every class.
[42:14.960 --> 42:16.160]  And then we have a control.
[42:16.160 --> 42:18.480]  What would be my D.V.?
[42:18.480 --> 42:19.400]  What would be my D.V.?
[42:19.400 --> 42:21.600]  What is the outcome that I'm interested in?
[42:21.600 --> 42:22.240]  Yes, Aaron.
[42:22.240 --> 42:23.040]  The grade in the course.
[42:23.040 --> 42:24.720]  The grade in the course on the midterm.
[42:24.720 --> 42:25.200]  Right?
[42:25.200 --> 42:26.200]  OK, good.
[42:26.200 --> 42:26.720]  All right.
[42:26.720 --> 42:27.200]  So good.
[42:27.200 --> 42:31.920]  So we now have an experimental design put into place.
[42:31.920 --> 42:35.560]  So I randomly sampled this group for you.
[42:35.560 --> 42:37.120]  It's a random sample.
[42:37.120 --> 42:40.680]  Why I'm saying it's random sampling
[42:40.680 --> 42:45.120]  is because you are representative of all the second year
[42:45.120 --> 42:48.440]  OB students in Canada.
[42:48.440 --> 42:49.440]  OK?
[42:49.440 --> 42:50.960]  So that's random sampling.
[42:50.960 --> 42:53.000]  So now I have an experimental design.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.280]  I have you come into the lab.
[42:55.280 --> 42:56.640]  Right?
[42:56.640 --> 42:58.480]  Now random assignment happens.
[42:58.480 --> 43:00.200]  So what does that mean?
[43:00.200 --> 43:01.480]  What does that mean?
[43:01.480 --> 43:02.400]  Yes, Aaron.
[43:02.400 --> 43:04.320]  Oh, specific people go into the lab?
[43:04.320 --> 43:06.280]  Yeah, but it's randomly done.
[43:07.080 --> 43:08.200]  What was your name, Aaron?
[43:08.200 --> 43:08.720]  Andrew.
[43:08.720 --> 43:09.400]  Andrew.
[43:09.400 --> 43:09.920]  OK.
[43:09.920 --> 43:11.280]  So Andrew's right.
[43:11.280 --> 43:14.280]  Specific people go into different groups.
[43:14.280 --> 43:15.840]  But how might that be?
[43:15.840 --> 43:17.680]  Maybe it's a draw.
[43:17.680 --> 43:19.400]  Maybe it's from a hat.
[43:19.400 --> 43:20.200]  Right?
[43:20.200 --> 43:21.440]  So Andrew comes in.
[43:21.440 --> 43:22.400]  Here's a hat.
[43:22.400 --> 43:24.040]  One says this condition.
[43:24.040 --> 43:25.800]  The other one says this condition.
[43:25.800 --> 43:27.640]  And that's how he's assigned.
[43:27.640 --> 43:31.280]  Or maybe I randomly assign you using a computer.
[43:31.280 --> 43:32.680]  Sort of like how I did the groups.
[43:32.680 --> 43:33.000]  Right?
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.160]  That was randomly assigning you to the groups.
[43:35.160 --> 43:36.200]  You don't know each other.
[43:36.200 --> 43:37.840]  I'm just like, here's the computer.
[43:37.840 --> 43:39.160]  Put them into groups.
[43:39.160 --> 43:40.920]  Same thing here.
[43:40.920 --> 43:42.040]  Makes sense?
[43:42.040 --> 43:43.280]  So do we understand that?
[43:43.280 --> 43:45.600]  Do we understand random assignment?
[43:45.600 --> 43:46.400]  Good.
[43:46.400 --> 43:47.440]  OK.
[43:47.440 --> 43:49.280]  So random assignment, what it does
[43:49.280 --> 43:52.880]  is it strengthens internal validity.
[43:52.880 --> 43:53.600]  OK?
[43:53.600 --> 43:58.200]  It helps make sure that the differences in the outcomes
[43:58.200 --> 44:01.480]  are likely due to the treatment and not other factors.
[44:01.480 --> 44:04.760]  Are likely due to the experimental manipulation
[44:04.760 --> 44:05.760]  and not other factors.
[44:08.960 --> 44:10.360]  Make sense?
[44:10.360 --> 44:10.840]  OK.
[44:10.840 --> 44:13.600]  So what's the main thing that I want you to take away from this?
[44:13.600 --> 44:15.360]  So tell me again.
[44:15.360 --> 44:18.240]  Between correlational and you're going
[44:18.240 --> 44:19.600]  to know the offer and effect.
[44:19.600 --> 44:22.720]  But between correlational and experimental.
[44:22.720 --> 44:24.080]  Tell me the main difference.
[44:28.480 --> 44:29.960]  Yes?
[44:29.960 --> 44:33.480]  Correlational is that there isn't a causal relationship
[44:33.480 --> 44:34.440]  with experimental.
[44:34.440 --> 44:35.600]  It can be all correlational.
[44:35.600 --> 44:36.600]  Exactly.
[44:36.600 --> 44:38.600]  That is the main thing.
[44:38.600 --> 44:41.200]  So in correlational, it only tells you
[44:41.200 --> 44:45.040]  whether or not there's an association or a relationship.
[44:45.040 --> 44:47.800]  It does not tell you what leads to what.
[44:47.800 --> 44:50.440]  So there's no cause and effect put into place.
[44:50.440 --> 44:50.920]  OK.
[44:50.920 --> 44:53.440]  So that's the first thing I want you to take away from this.
[44:53.440 --> 44:58.840]  And the second is just how to design an experimental design.
[44:58.840 --> 45:03.000]  So if something, if you need to design an experimental design,
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.480]  understand that there is a treatment
[45:05.480 --> 45:08.600]  or an experimental group, understand the fact
[45:08.600 --> 45:11.200]  that there is a control group, understand
[45:11.200 --> 45:14.000]  that you're going to randomly sample, also understand
[45:14.000 --> 45:15.760]  that there is going to be random assignment.
[45:15.760 --> 45:17.000]  Four key words.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.320]  So remember this?
[45:19.320 --> 45:21.600]  Yes?
[45:21.600 --> 45:22.560]  Good.
[45:22.560 --> 45:23.400]  OK.
[45:23.400 --> 45:23.920]  All right.
[45:23.920 --> 45:26.040]  Now let's talk about ethics very quickly.
[45:26.040 --> 45:30.920]  Researchers, they have a moral and professional responsibility
[45:30.960 --> 45:35.280]  to basically conduct research vigorously
[45:35.280 --> 45:38.880]  and to report the findings truthfully.
[45:38.880 --> 45:40.160]  OK.
[45:40.160 --> 45:44.720]  They also have the moral and professional responsibility
[45:44.720 --> 45:49.120]  to protect the well-being of their participants.
[45:49.120 --> 45:49.640]  OK.
[45:49.640 --> 45:51.440]  So there are a couple of different things
[45:51.440 --> 45:53.640]  that go into play.
[45:53.640 --> 45:57.200]  So what are some key ethical principles when it comes to these?
[45:57.200 --> 45:59.320]  Well, you have to give them informed consent.
[45:59.360 --> 46:03.560]  So if you participated in the research, which you should have,
[46:03.560 --> 46:06.760]  like that long acronym, do we remember?
[46:06.760 --> 46:08.080]  Who is it?
[46:08.080 --> 46:12.440]  LR, L, RP, whatever.
[46:12.440 --> 46:13.840]  L is it, whatever it was.
[46:13.840 --> 46:16.240]  Make sure you're going to participate in those.
[46:16.240 --> 46:19.480]  You're going to get three marks, three percentages.
[46:19.480 --> 46:22.000]  So if you have gone through that already,
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.880]  you would have noticed that they actually
[46:23.880 --> 46:28.000]  give you a piece of paper at the very beginning
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.560]  for you to read and sign.
[46:30.560 --> 46:32.240]  Have you noticed that yet?
[46:32.240 --> 46:35.480]  How many of us have engaged in it?
[46:35.480 --> 46:36.680]  Jenny has.
[46:36.680 --> 46:38.480]  OK, a few of you have.
[46:38.480 --> 46:41.080]  I better see more hands next week.
[46:41.080 --> 46:43.320]  And then I don't want you to be in a position
[46:43.320 --> 46:45.440]  where you're like begging me for marks,
[46:45.440 --> 46:47.320]  so I'm going to shut it down.
[46:47.320 --> 46:48.360]  Right?
[46:48.360 --> 46:50.280]  So get those three percent.
[46:50.280 --> 46:52.680]  So next week, I better see more hands.
