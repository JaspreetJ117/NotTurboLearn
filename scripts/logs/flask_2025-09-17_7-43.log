[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  So I closed the summer number one.
[00:06.000 --> 00:14.000]  You can see all my new space here.
[00:14.000 --> 00:19.000]  So now I have some of the same new rules for summer number one.
[00:19.000 --> 00:23.000]  For the new one, I usually want to close in here.
[00:23.000 --> 00:32.000]  And so the new date will be ten days from here to here.
[00:32.000 --> 00:41.000]  And then as you can see, you can go from content.
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  And then the summer rules.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  Then that's your assignments.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  You can download here.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  That's about introduction.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  This gives you briefly introduce you what is PLP function,
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  how do you use it to find the moment,
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  giving the rate and the loan.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  The loan actually is present value as to its PLP.
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  And also if you read this and you understand what that mean,
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  then you can do a lot of things here.
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  Now this is introduction.
[01:36.000 --> 01:45.000]  We doing the PMT function to find the monthly payment for the mortgage.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  And you can do two ways.
[01:47.000 --> 01:56.000]  One is, as I have here, just use Excel PMT function.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  That function is very easy.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  Just like that.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  Just write equal, type this equation.
[02:05.000 --> 02:14.000]  And then type this Excel given equation, PLP, and the rate and so on.
[02:14.000 --> 02:19.000]  And now next is, so that's kind of in this assignment,
[02:19.000 --> 02:31.000]  this assignment is just to give you, ask you to perform how to type the Excel given functions.
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  And next is, in reality, Excel may not give you equations as much.
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  You may have your own model.
[02:43.000 --> 02:52.000]  So that's the second method here.
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  As you can see here.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  You can use this equation.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  That's the equation.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  So that means when you input, when you write a number,
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  then you need to use this instead of just use PMT and then you input numbers.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  Now you just need to put everything in here.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  But it's okay like this.
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  It's not too hard.
[03:22.000 --> 03:31.000]  But these rate PB and then PER and R given equations,
[03:31.000 --> 03:40.000]  and so you can find to meet these given conditions, you should get exactly the same answer.
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  And so you can use these two methods.
[03:45.000 --> 03:53.000]  So in your assignment, I do have the answer.
[03:54.000 --> 04:05.000]  So in your assignment, I do have this step one, two, three, four, five.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  And originally, previous year, I did not have the steps.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  I just had a description.
[04:13.000 --> 04:20.000]  Now I thought maybe it's easier for you guys to understand one, two, three, and down.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  So you just follow these steps, then to do the work.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  Then, and rubrics.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  Here.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  Rubrics is here.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  So you know which steps you will come in for.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  So this is part A. I have part A and part B.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  So I took parts.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  Now also I have these.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  I post these.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  That's what I do.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  My results there.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  So you can follow just the results.
[04:58.000 --> 05:05.000]  So you should double check if you use the same number.
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  You can just use the same number so I can check.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  Exactly the same.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  And then you can get the answer.
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.000]  So that's for part A.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  And part B in the following page.
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  On the following page, you will see it's just like an easy equation.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  You two get the same.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  And remember, also you need to graph.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  So that's about your assignment, A1.
[05:38.000 --> 05:45.000]  And your A2 will be, I think it's still far away from now.
[05:45.000 --> 05:53.000]  By A2, you will write, I believe one of the parts, part A,
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  will be part A. Only a few points.
[05:58.000 --> 06:03.000]  You will write the VBA code to do everything here.
[06:03.000 --> 06:08.000]  Here now, part two is doing math.
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.000]  You just need to do math to do everything.
[06:11.000 --> 06:15.000]  So from there, you know how to do math, right?
[06:18.000 --> 06:24.000]  Then, as I said, in your assignment, you will write code to do this.
[06:24.000 --> 06:27.000]  So the same thing, you can do different ways.
[06:27.000 --> 06:28.000]  Okay.
[06:28.000 --> 06:33.000]  And that's about your assignment information.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  Do you have any questions?
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  Yeah, I think you need to do both.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  That one.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  You're working.
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  I just want to say.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  I already have this assignment.
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.000]  I did not give you anything.
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  Like it's still far away from now to the question.
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.000]  This.
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  The question about the second part and the second part.
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.000]  The second part, yes.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  Doing the same thing.
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  Part B, right?
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  Use math.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  Math.
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  You just do this.
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  I have the instruction, you just do the same.
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  But you record it.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  The second part is using math.
[07:17.000 --> 07:20.000]  The first.
[07:20.000 --> 07:21.000]  The first.
[07:21.000 --> 07:22.000]  Paray?
[07:22.000 --> 07:23.000]  Yes.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  You examine manually.
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  Manually.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  Paray is manually.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  You do the same.
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  Part B is math or automatic.
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  Never mind.
[07:36.000 --> 07:37.000]  It's fucking hard.
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  You record your process.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  Then you create a button.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  Control button.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  It's a lot of work.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  I'm not even like committed from here.
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  Change the channel.
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  So you see here.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  This is part A.
[08:18.000 --> 08:19.000]  Part A.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  So I have all the instructions asking you to change everything.
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.000]  Like including this.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  And part A is for PMP function.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  But you're doing manually everything.
[08:32.000 --> 08:39.000]  And part B is you are going to do math.
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.000]  And in the article, so you will know, you have to use this.
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  You have to record the macro, right?
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  Then after you do everything, then you stop.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  Then you want to create this.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  Control button.
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  And so.
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  This is a big, big, big.
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  Everything you've got.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  For example, I'm going to.
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  Also, you want to test your result.
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  I don't know anything.
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  But now.
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.000]  I mean, two.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  I mean, two things.
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  You'll get everything there.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  That's automation.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  Yeah.
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  Right?
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  So you need to submit the excel.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  XLSM.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  That's micro enabled.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.000]  Right.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  If you just use XLS, then.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  That's what I see in part two.
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  But when you have part one.
[09:53.000 --> 09:54.000]  You know this one.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  When you have the.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  Part one has 12 points.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  Part B has 8 points.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  And you should have 30 points.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  Right?
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  Any questions?
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  Just remember your part.
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  Part A is manual.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  Part B.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  Between the automation.
[10:21.000 --> 10:27.000]  You got to go by the order of control.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  Okay.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  That's like their version.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  Well, you updated it.
[10:37.000 --> 10:38.000]  Okay.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  So.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  All right.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  Let's go.
[10:43.000 --> 10:44.000]  Start.
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.000]  Okay.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  Let's go.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  Do they want it?
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  Do they want it?
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  Did it give you an idea?
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  They want it.
[10:54.000 --> 10:55.000]  Yeah, they bought it.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  Now, you can see.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  We're getting to the right immediate.
[10:58.000 --> 10:59.000]  So.
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.000]  So it's having a hard.
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  Well.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  You don't write code.
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.000]  You got to know the control.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  Will you use the code?
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  Oh, you went through his article.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  Okay.
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  So in this chapter, you still have a lot of content.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  I can do more faculty.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  You know what I'm doing?
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  I'm going to do the application.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  That was what I was ever going to do.
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  I'm just going to do the entry here.
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  And once you're listening, going to be artist.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  It's like a worksheet, a workbook.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  They can include the art.
[11:36.000 --> 11:42.000]  The art and you are in the defined argument.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  Define a, are declared these workbook or worksheet.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  So next time it's easy for us to refer to the workbook
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  or worksheet.
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.000]  And for sheet name, code name, when you write a big code,
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  some people have to use this.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  And feeling constant.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  And feeling constant.
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  When you move a mouse up and down,
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  this will respond to it.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  The feeling constant.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  And also make in a message box,
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  you can see OK button.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.000]  OK, like this button.
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  These all using building,
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  maybe it will be constant.
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  It doesn't write.
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.000]  So you're working different information.
[12:40.000 --> 12:46.000]  And also you can do input box or message box.
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  And by using the code.
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  Streams.
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  That's a very important thing.
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.000]  And building stream functions.
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  A lot of times you need to replace,
[13:01.000 --> 13:09.000]  you find some character along the streams.
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  And you want to replace, you want to delete.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  Delete is such a pile of names.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  And this is you need to search.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  You need to search a character.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  So you can use these building functions on the stream.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  And also you have the medical functions.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  And even when it's medical functions,
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  specifically in here also,
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  you have the square root of sine and cosine.
[13:44.000 --> 13:51.000]  And I want to say we do have excel functions.
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  And as you say, PNT function is well felt.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  And also how is your sound.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  And there are a little bit difference only in the fuses.
[14:04.000 --> 14:12.000]  A minor difference between the VBA and excel functions.
[14:12.000 --> 14:23.000]  For example, square root SQRT in excel function.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  Excel means use the spreadsheet into the things.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  Maybe if you write that, it doesn't reply to you.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  And it will give you error.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  It's SQRT.
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  And also like arctangent.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  So I will give the information.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  And with a general amount of R,
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  many R functions in excel,
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  we can take advantage of excel functions, PNT functions.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  We can use them.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  We can go larger.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  You can even create it.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  But you still can use it.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  So that's inside of here we will talk about that.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  And we specify object.
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  And this is really we want to do something here.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  How to write.
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.000]  So how to finish this chapter.
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  We will be able to write it.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000]  Not for the excel mode.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  But later on we will do the control groups and the VE groups.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  In the logic sense.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  And then following chapter.
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  And then following chapter will do the arrays.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  Right?
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  Then functions, some routines, call, many type of call.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  And routines.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  Right?
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  And so on.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  But now this is getting started.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  Once we've done this, you're all done.
[16:00.000 --> 16:01.000]  Okay.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  Now let's move to the next.
[16:06.000 --> 16:11.000]  So the subgroup team, we all know you already have the experience.
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  And a program.
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  Program is a big thing in the law.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  Law 432.
[16:18.000 --> 16:19.000]  Or subs.
[16:19.000 --> 16:23.000]  Many call subs as a being one.
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  And subgroup team.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  So we're going to install some VBA interface.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  VBA.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  And install the module.
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  As you can recall in the last chapter we said we use insert.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  And insert.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  And it will insert module.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  The full module.
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  And also use a form from there.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  And so that's in the modules.
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  That's where we see the code.
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.000]  Where we access the code.
[17:03.000 --> 17:09.000]  And so what we want to do is we click development and it goes to.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  Oh, this is for if you don't have development.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  As we mentioned earlier.
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.000]  We mentioned in the last chapter.
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  And you can go with this, right?
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  We mentioned from last chapter.
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  This one is not by default you have that.
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.000]  You have.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  If you don't have this, you can.
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.000]  No worries.
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  It's all here.
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.000]  By all means.
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.000]  Choose option.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  Choose customer reason.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  And check.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  Because then it will be here.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  And now here you can see.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  See the base module.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  And.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  And I see analog.
[17:50.000 --> 17:51.000]  And now.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  To do your control button.
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  Your assignment.
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  You use here.
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  Insert.
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  Click this insert.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  Then you will see that you can change the box.
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  That's control box.
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  Right?
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.000]  And.
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  And then.
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  Click on the.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  Well, it will be.
[18:14.000 --> 18:15.000]  Basic.
[18:15.000 --> 18:16.000]  Then the editor.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  Window will pop up.
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  And that's.
[18:22.000 --> 18:23.000]  So now.
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  For this one.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  You need to know.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  What.
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  The three of the things.
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  Are most important.
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  And these.
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  This.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  Project is for.
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  That's.
[18:38.000 --> 18:39.000]  That's right.
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  It just over you what you have.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  And so.
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  What you have.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  That's what I have.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  And what you have inside.
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.000]  What you have.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  But.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  Then.
[18:51.000 --> 18:52.000]  And going down.
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  If you have.
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  If you have.
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.000]  The module.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.000]  It will show.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.000]  Okay.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  And then.
[19:01.000 --> 19:02.000]  Optic windows.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  Is here.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  This is for.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  Browser.
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  Objective browser.
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  So you want familiar with.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.000]  These.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  Things.
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  Now.
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  Now this is the.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  Excel VBA.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  This.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  Editor window.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  So these are the bars.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  Here this is typo bar.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  Is here.
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  The file you have.
[19:30.000 --> 19:31.000]  And.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  The manual bar is here.
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  And.
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  Now.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  If you want to write a video code.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  First thing you want to do is.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  Then the module will show up.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  And that's the module.
[19:48.000 --> 19:49.000]  That's the module.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  Where.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  You can hold.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  All the code.
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.000]  All.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  Of course you can.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  This kind of.
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  You know.
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  One.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  Full.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.000]  Of.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  Of.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.000]  Of.
[20:01.000 --> 20:02.000]  Of.
[20:02.000 --> 20:03.000]  Of.
[20:03.000 --> 20:04.000]  Of.
[20:04.000 --> 20:05.000]  Of.
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.000]  Of.
[20:06.000 --> 20:07.000]  Of.
[20:07.000 --> 20:08.000]  Of.
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.000]  Of.
[20:09.000 --> 20:10.000]  Of.
[20:10.000 --> 20:11.000]  Of.
[20:11.000 --> 20:12.000]  Of.
[20:12.000 --> 20:13.000]  Of.
[20:13.000 --> 20:14.000]  Of.
[20:14.000 --> 20:15.000]  Of.
[20:15.000 --> 20:16.000]  Of.
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.000]  Of.
[20:17.000 --> 20:18.000]  Of.
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  Of.
[20:19.000 --> 20:20.000]  Of.
[20:20.000 --> 20:21.000]  Of.
[20:21.000 --> 20:22.000]  Of.
[20:22.000 --> 20:23.000]  Of.
[20:23.000 --> 20:24.000]  Of.
[20:24.000 --> 20:25.000]  Of.
[20:25.000 --> 20:26.000]  Of.
[20:26.000 --> 20:27.000]  I have assignment.
[20:27.000 --> 20:28.000]  Not.
[20:28.000 --> 20:29.000]  Let's say.
[20:29.000 --> 20:30.000]  I have assignment two.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  I have two parts.
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  Of your work.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  Part A and part B.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  I might ask you.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  Don't.
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.000]  Don't put together.
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.000]  Because if you don't put together.
[20:41.000 --> 20:42.000]  Put together now.
[20:42.000 --> 20:48.080]  If I encode or chuck, then it's mixed.
[20:48.080 --> 20:51.560]  So you might need to insert module.
[20:51.560 --> 20:53.480]  And by default, it's module one.
[20:53.480 --> 20:58.440]  Then you want to change the name by doing here.
[20:58.440 --> 21:00.400]  Because this is the property.
[21:00.400 --> 21:02.640]  If you click this and right-click key,
[21:02.640 --> 21:05.520]  it will show the property windows.
[21:05.520 --> 21:07.920]  Then you can change the name to my name.
[21:07.920 --> 21:09.560]  I'll say part A.
[21:09.560 --> 21:13.520]  The next one, you create another insert, another module.
[21:13.520 --> 21:17.520]  Then you start to add part B. Then in part A,
[21:17.520 --> 21:21.520]  you just put all your code in part A, part B, all your code
[21:21.520 --> 21:22.520]  in part E.
[21:22.520 --> 21:23.000]  Right?
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.480]  So don't put it together.
[21:26.480 --> 21:26.960]  Right?
[21:26.960 --> 21:33.440]  So now let's add a code with this.
[21:33.440 --> 21:34.920]  The code with this here.
[21:35.280 --> 21:36.760]  Just click this.
[21:36.760 --> 21:40.240]  Then you're showing these windows.
[21:40.240 --> 21:44.720]  And then you just write a code.
[21:44.720 --> 21:48.200]  Now, video, the tool.
[21:48.200 --> 21:49.680]  So now, where is the tool box?
[21:49.680 --> 21:54.680]  Tool box is this one, and standard, and robot editor.
[21:54.680 --> 21:57.160]  And this one is debugging.
[21:57.160 --> 21:58.640]  And debug.
[21:58.640 --> 22:03.640]  And the robot editor.
[22:03.840 --> 22:08.840]  So you notice, like indent, then comment, and uncomment,
[22:08.840 --> 22:10.040]  all these.
[22:10.040 --> 22:14.080]  And here, I must have these windows for watching
[22:14.080 --> 22:15.080]  what's going on inside.
[22:18.560 --> 22:19.040]  OK.
[22:19.040 --> 22:22.640]  So if you don't see these, you can also
[22:22.640 --> 22:27.040]  use view, owner, and click here.
[22:27.040 --> 22:29.040]  You're showing the property view.
[22:29.040 --> 22:31.040]  It's here.
[22:31.440 --> 22:39.440]  And the project window is the project voice.
[22:39.440 --> 22:45.440]  And the property window is this one.
[22:45.440 --> 22:48.440]  So project is called property window.
[22:48.440 --> 22:51.920]  Then next, this is property window.
[22:51.920 --> 22:54.920]  Then immediate window is this one.
[22:54.920 --> 22:57.920]  And it's very fun, this one.
[22:58.280 --> 23:02.280]  With the key, the red key.
[23:02.280 --> 23:04.280]  And the loophole would be this one.
[23:04.280 --> 23:06.280]  This one would be watching.
[23:06.280 --> 23:09.280]  Loophole, loophole, loophole.
[23:09.280 --> 23:10.280]  And watching with glasses.
[23:13.760 --> 23:15.760]  And so these are from the back.
[23:15.760 --> 23:19.760]  You see what's going on inside the short code.
[23:19.760 --> 23:25.760]  And it might be in the box, the short code, the brick code.
[23:26.080 --> 23:32.560]  So brick code is on here, all the way side, all the way here.
[23:36.560 --> 23:42.040]  And now, what about some of the names?
[23:42.040 --> 23:42.540]  Names.
[23:46.040 --> 23:52.040]  The names can be a combination of several words.
[23:52.320 --> 23:57.320]  You don't want to have space or spatial to have it,
[23:57.320 --> 24:00.320]  except on the score.
[24:00.320 --> 24:03.320]  On the score is O, G, K.
[24:03.320 --> 24:06.320]  And then sub-t names.
[24:06.320 --> 24:09.320]  And you have these, sub, and there
[24:09.320 --> 24:13.320]  is the names, sub, and there is the space.
[24:13.320 --> 24:15.320]  And N is this.
[24:15.320 --> 24:18.320]  Always have N.
[24:18.600 --> 24:22.600]  And you can take arguments.
[24:22.600 --> 24:24.600]  For now, for this chapter, next chapter,
[24:24.600 --> 24:26.600]  we don't take any argument.
[24:26.600 --> 24:28.600]  This new how we go.
[24:28.600 --> 24:31.600]  The routines, you have input, output.
[24:31.600 --> 24:35.600]  You can't, next time if you want to call, you have input.
[24:35.600 --> 24:39.600]  And you have get out, results.
[24:39.600 --> 24:43.600]  And input and output, you can put inside.
[24:43.600 --> 24:45.600]  But for now, we don't have it.
[24:45.600 --> 24:47.600]  We just put everything inside.
[24:48.380 --> 24:51.880]  So we just write this empty.
[24:51.880 --> 24:54.880]  And that is it.
[24:54.880 --> 24:57.880]  Just leave it as empty.
[24:57.880 --> 25:01.880]  So here, module.
[25:01.880 --> 25:03.880]  And module, as I said, module inside
[25:03.880 --> 25:06.880]  can include many of them.
[25:06.880 --> 25:08.880]  Many points of group.
[25:08.880 --> 25:12.880]  Then next is, how she explains it.
[25:12.880 --> 25:16.880]  We need to use this usually.
[25:17.160 --> 25:20.160]  And it looks like we need to use this.
[25:20.160 --> 25:26.160]  This is the typical example that always on top,
[25:26.160 --> 25:30.160]  it's actually placed on top.
[25:30.160 --> 25:32.160]  And that's the first.
[25:32.160 --> 25:36.160]  So if I ask you, what does this mean?
[25:36.160 --> 25:45.160]  It really means it force you to declare
[25:45.440 --> 25:48.440]  these variables.
[25:48.440 --> 25:50.440]  Because sometimes if you don't close,
[25:50.440 --> 25:52.440]  you will probably forgot to be right.
[25:52.440 --> 25:53.440]  Hold.
[25:53.440 --> 25:55.440]  And this is just to give you.
[25:55.440 --> 25:58.440]  If you don't, they will be in a wrong condition.
[25:58.440 --> 26:01.440]  If you don't, you declare your variable.
[26:01.440 --> 26:07.440]  So that's, it force us to declare a variable.
[26:07.440 --> 26:08.440]  Right?
[26:08.440 --> 26:10.440]  Right?
[26:10.440 --> 26:13.440]  Now, that's the way you see it.
[26:13.440 --> 26:14.440]  Always on the top.
[26:15.220 --> 26:19.720]  How do you do this automatically when you write a code?
[26:19.720 --> 26:21.720]  It's here.
[26:21.720 --> 26:24.720]  It goes towards the editor.
[26:24.720 --> 26:27.720]  From the editor, you have towards option,
[26:27.720 --> 26:30.720]  then you see here, towards option,
[26:30.720 --> 26:32.720]  then you click here, edit.
[26:32.720 --> 26:37.720]  So you apply a variable to clear the region.
[26:37.720 --> 26:42.720]  And now, once you have this checked,
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  you automatically clear it.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  You don't need to write a message by your own.
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  Because you don't want to write everything by your own,
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  by yourself, right?
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  And on here, also, you can see we've thought it.
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  And it's so nice, because you couldn't write it in your windows.
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  And here, you click on, and you can draw it.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  And all on top of it, for different variables.
[27:12.280 --> 27:13.280]  Right?
[27:13.280 --> 27:20.280]  This, sometimes, you only use it if you couldn't write it in your windows.
[27:20.280 --> 27:21.280]  Right?
[27:21.280 --> 27:22.280]  Right?
[27:22.280 --> 27:24.280]  Now, next.
[27:28.280 --> 27:30.280]  Verbal.
[27:30.280 --> 27:33.280]  A verbal, we need to use verbal.
[27:33.280 --> 27:38.280]  It's really important to store information.
[27:38.280 --> 27:39.280]  Right?
[27:39.560 --> 27:48.560]  And now, how do we, what, how many types of them are?
[27:48.560 --> 27:57.560]  And how many types of them are, for an integer?
[27:57.560 --> 28:01.560]  And for the integer, the only thing you use,
[28:01.560 --> 28:08.560]  if I can, in being, I, as integer.
[28:08.840 --> 28:11.840]  And I only hold the number of bits.
[28:11.840 --> 28:13.840]  This is really not a big number.
[28:13.840 --> 28:14.840]  Right?
[28:14.840 --> 28:18.840]  So, sometimes, you need to use this, now.
[28:18.840 --> 28:21.840]  Like, if you have a large number, but for it,
[28:21.840 --> 28:26.840]  you can imagine the integer again is huge.
[28:26.840 --> 28:27.840]  Right?
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.840]  So, in that case, you cannot hold any more than this, at all.
[28:31.840 --> 28:32.840]  Okay?
[28:32.840 --> 28:33.840]  Right?
[28:34.120 --> 28:35.120]  And that's it.
[28:35.120 --> 28:37.120]  It's not an integer, and that means what?
[28:37.120 --> 28:39.120]  Single or double.
[28:39.120 --> 28:42.120]  For a given, I can't see them.
[28:45.120 --> 28:48.120]  And a single or double.
[28:48.120 --> 28:51.120]  A double, we know, but I guess, sometimes,
[28:51.120 --> 28:56.120]  we use the separate digits, what we call it, company.
[28:56.120 --> 29:01.120]  And that means, after the decimal.
[29:01.400 --> 29:03.400]  And next, is the string.
[29:03.400 --> 29:05.400]  The string is the big cities.
[29:05.400 --> 29:06.400]  Right?
[29:06.400 --> 29:12.400]  We have to clear a character, or a sentence, with the string.
[29:12.400 --> 29:15.400]  And then, this one is very important.
[29:15.400 --> 29:16.400]  Bully.
[29:16.400 --> 29:21.400]  Sometimes, we need to find if it's true, or if it's false.
[29:21.400 --> 29:28.400]  So, if you have a bully, you can declare a bully variable.
[29:28.400 --> 29:29.400]  Right?
[29:31.900 --> 29:40.400]  And then, currency, date, and finally,
[29:40.400 --> 29:43.400]  and we have variant.
[29:43.400 --> 29:52.400]  Variant is defined variable as, it can catch the whole.
[29:52.400 --> 29:57.400]  Then, if it can serves as, if your data is integer,
[29:57.400 --> 30:01.680]  it serves as an integer.
[30:01.680 --> 30:06.680]  So, whatever, it's just so flexible.
[30:06.680 --> 30:10.680]  It can hold any types of data.
[30:10.680 --> 30:12.680]  Hold any types of data.
[30:12.680 --> 30:18.680]  And you can really determine if any type of data
[30:18.680 --> 30:20.680]  according to what you have.
[30:20.680 --> 30:21.680]  OK?
[30:21.960 --> 30:26.960]  And normally, it's really fun.
[30:26.960 --> 30:30.960]  You don't really want to use that often,
[30:30.960 --> 30:33.960]  because it's less efficient.
[30:33.960 --> 30:36.960]  So, you don't want to use that often,
[30:36.960 --> 30:40.960]  because it's less efficient.
[30:40.960 --> 30:43.960]  So, these are the variables.
[30:44.240 --> 30:49.240]  Now, that's how we declare.
[30:49.240 --> 30:54.240]  How do we declare the deem, j, as?
[30:54.240 --> 31:01.240]  So, you can see, we must start from deem, then as.
[31:01.240 --> 31:06.240]  And change your variable as what variable type.
[31:06.240 --> 31:11.240]  So, that must be this deem.
[31:11.520 --> 31:16.520]  That must be this deem, as.
[31:16.520 --> 31:19.000]  Deem.
[31:19.000 --> 31:27.000]  And now, if I have deem i, j, k, all three of them,
[31:27.000 --> 31:34.480]  all integers, then you have to deem everything.
[31:34.480 --> 31:35.960]  See here?
[31:35.960 --> 31:39.440]  From i to j, and from to k.
[31:39.640 --> 31:44.120]  And you can put one line by line.
[31:44.120 --> 31:49.120]  And all you can put on the one line is a complex.
[31:49.120 --> 31:56.120]  And now, if I write in this deem,
[31:56.120 --> 31:59.120]  it does seem as this.
[31:59.120 --> 32:01.120]  Two.
[32:01.120 --> 32:08.120]  And so, this two means this only has k as integer.
[32:08.800 --> 32:13.800]  And so, if you have to declare i, j, you really do not declare
[32:13.800 --> 32:14.800]  as anything.
[32:14.800 --> 32:17.800]  So, that really is a variant.
[32:17.800 --> 32:20.800]  For a self-adjective, think about it.
[32:20.800 --> 32:23.800]  It's a variant, not an integer.
[32:23.800 --> 32:27.800]  And so, that's the difference here.
[32:27.800 --> 32:28.800]  If you don't have that.
[32:28.800 --> 32:30.800]  So, that means, if you don't do this,
[32:30.800 --> 32:34.800]  you cannot omit the as integer.
[32:34.800 --> 32:36.800]  You have to put everything here.
[32:37.480 --> 32:40.480]  All right?
[32:40.480 --> 32:43.480]  Now, that's the same.
[32:43.480 --> 32:46.480]  You want to be careful.
[32:46.480 --> 32:51.480]  And we can always use intelligence.
[32:51.480 --> 32:55.480]  And intelligence just use control space.
[32:55.480 --> 32:56.480]  Then it can shoot.
[32:56.480 --> 33:01.480]  If you use control space, then it will shoot all of these
[33:01.480 --> 33:05.480]  properties, and that's the other things, and the names,
[33:06.160 --> 33:11.160]  and so, if I try, for example, I have these.
[33:11.160 --> 33:17.160]  If you declare, if you declare the degree to the radian,
[33:17.160 --> 33:19.160]  this is going to be long.
[33:19.160 --> 33:24.160]  And now, if you declare it will shoot here,
[33:24.160 --> 33:27.160]  you use the control on space.
[33:27.160 --> 33:32.160]  And it will shoot whenever you just type three words,
[33:32.160 --> 33:34.160]  three words, it will shoot here.
[33:34.840 --> 33:35.840]  So, that's the space.
[33:35.840 --> 33:37.840]  That's the space, and then you'll be good.
[33:37.840 --> 33:39.840]  You don't need to type all.
[33:42.840 --> 33:45.840]  How do you declare constant?
[33:45.840 --> 33:49.840]  You declare constant is constant to what?
[33:49.840 --> 33:51.840]  Three.
[33:51.840 --> 33:54.840]  That's the format of, you declare constant.
[34:00.840 --> 34:01.840]  Next.
[34:02.520 --> 34:06.520]  And object variable.
[34:06.520 --> 34:15.520]  And object variable refers to the work of, and all these things.
[34:15.520 --> 34:22.520]  And so, when we declare the achieve, or range, or,
[34:22.520 --> 34:27.520]  we can declare range.
[34:28.200 --> 34:34.200]  And this way, it is convenient, convenient for us to refer it
[34:34.200 --> 34:35.200]  either, right?
[34:35.200 --> 34:39.200]  Otherwise, we have to write long things, right?
[34:39.200 --> 34:44.200]  And so, it was still on the reference, but it's not just,
[34:44.200 --> 34:48.200]  it isn't referred to the image itself,
[34:48.200 --> 34:51.200]  only refers to object.
[34:51.200 --> 34:56.200]  So, we can also do this, but, but, and,
[34:58.200 --> 35:02.200]  object, declare object is different with this
[35:02.200 --> 35:04.200]  declare variable.
[35:04.200 --> 35:05.200]  Okay?
[35:05.200 --> 35:07.200]  Declare variable, you know, is variable.
[35:07.200 --> 35:09.200]  It's a number, so only one, right?
[35:09.200 --> 35:13.200]  And this, and then object might be special,
[35:13.200 --> 35:15.200]  and then what is the advantage of this?
[35:15.200 --> 35:18.200]  You have to set.
[35:18.200 --> 35:20.200]  Okay, that's the key thing.
[35:20.200 --> 35:25.200]  After you've done this set, you will have long,
[35:25.200 --> 35:30.200]  you will have long, and long, and long, and long,
[35:30.200 --> 35:33.200]  and long, and long, and long, and long.
[35:33.200 --> 35:38.200]  And that will give you the syntax error, as you can see here.
[35:38.200 --> 35:43.200]  But in range as range, RNG as range.
[35:46.680 --> 35:51.680]  And the reason we cannot use reserved word,
[35:51.680 --> 35:53.680]  and for here, so now,
[35:53.680 --> 35:57.660]  And meaning also belittled as range.
[35:57.660 --> 36:03.620]  And set, so here set, range is equal to what?
[36:03.620 --> 36:06.620]  So what starting with this?
[36:06.620 --> 36:10.120]  And then this, you see here, what sheet?
[36:10.120 --> 36:14.120]  So this refers to what?
[36:14.120 --> 36:18.620]  The what sheet named method, what?
[36:18.620 --> 36:23.120]  You have to use this double quotes.
[36:23.120 --> 36:25.100]  And then dot, range.
[36:25.100 --> 36:28.100]  And also you have to use these double quotes.
[36:28.100 --> 36:30.600]  This is a double quote.
[36:30.600 --> 36:33.100]  And that refers to the range.
[36:33.100 --> 36:36.600]  Then also you can do the what sheets.
[36:36.600 --> 36:41.600]  What sheets as in set, what sheet?
[36:41.600 --> 36:43.100]  Equal to what?
[36:43.100 --> 36:45.600]  You see here now, what sheets?
[36:45.600 --> 36:47.100]  And what sheets?
[36:47.100 --> 36:52.600]  And that refers to the name of the what sheet.
[36:53.060 --> 36:55.560]  And this is the spreadsheet.
[36:55.560 --> 36:56.060]  Great.
[36:59.560 --> 37:05.560]  Now next is objects and collections.
[37:05.560 --> 37:13.560]  And so if you look at here, when you see here sheets,
[37:13.560 --> 37:18.060]  right, when you see here work sheets,
[37:19.020 --> 37:22.520]  if you write a worksheet, does it work?
[37:22.520 --> 37:23.020]  No.
[37:23.020 --> 37:24.520]  Wrong.
[37:24.520 --> 37:29.020]  Because it only refers to this worksheet's collection
[37:29.020 --> 37:32.520]  with the name of that.
[37:32.520 --> 37:37.020]  So that's, you need to use these collections here.
[37:37.020 --> 37:42.520]  But first, these work sheets, sheets collection,
[37:42.520 --> 37:44.020]  is a natural one.
[37:44.480 --> 37:47.980]  Because seeing your spreadsheet and the new itself,
[37:47.980 --> 37:49.980]  I know you can do the charts.
[37:49.980 --> 37:51.980]  And you can insert charts.
[37:51.980 --> 37:53.980]  You can insert what sheets, right?
[37:53.980 --> 37:59.980]  The sheets include charts and work sheets.
[37:59.980 --> 38:01.480]  You know what I mean?
[38:01.480 --> 38:02.980]  This is a large one.
[38:02.980 --> 38:06.980]  You can hold, focus.
[38:06.980 --> 38:10.480]  And then what sheets is, when you use this,
[38:11.440 --> 38:14.440]  this is just a simple worksheet.
[38:14.440 --> 38:20.940]  And what sheets is collection of including the all work sheets
[38:20.940 --> 38:24.440]  including in workbook.
[38:24.440 --> 38:30.940]  Now next one, and charts.
[38:30.940 --> 38:36.440]  Charts refers to that single chart.
[38:36.440 --> 38:38.940]  Just like this means a single worksheet.
[38:39.400 --> 38:40.900]  This refers to a collection.
[38:44.400 --> 38:48.900]  When you have plural S, then that's collection.
[38:51.900 --> 38:56.400]  Then there are these rules.
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.900]  Reserve the keyword, and you need this object.
[39:00.900 --> 39:03.400]  Name is cannot be used.
[39:03.400 --> 39:05.400]  That makes sense, right?
[39:05.400 --> 39:06.900]  Because this is reserved.
[39:06.900 --> 39:07.400]  Right?
[39:09.900 --> 39:17.400]  And they start with a letter.
[39:17.400 --> 39:19.900]  They start with a letter.
[39:19.900 --> 39:23.400]  And no space.
[39:23.400 --> 39:26.900]  And no spatial property.
[39:26.900 --> 39:31.400]  And except on the scoreboard.
[39:31.400 --> 39:32.900]  Except on the scoreboard.
[39:32.900 --> 39:36.400]  And also case and in sensitivity.
[39:36.400 --> 39:37.900]  In sensitivity.
[39:38.860 --> 39:42.360]  And I mean that's your verbal name in case in sensitivity.
[39:42.360 --> 39:45.860]  Just follow the first.
[39:45.860 --> 39:48.860]  When you do the declared, right?
[39:48.860 --> 39:52.360]  And just in the declared, you use capital word.
[39:52.360 --> 39:56.860]  Then next time you write lowercase.
[39:56.860 --> 40:02.360]  Now it will automatically change into the capital word.
[40:02.360 --> 40:04.860]  Just follow the first time you use.
[40:04.860 --> 40:06.360]  That makes sense, right?
[40:08.360 --> 40:18.860]  And now I have a few examples.
[40:27.360 --> 40:30.860]  Now we cannot use these because this is a strategist number.
[40:30.860 --> 40:33.360]  And we cannot use because you have space.
[40:33.360 --> 40:34.860]  Input.
[40:34.860 --> 40:37.360]  Input cannot use because see?
[40:37.820 --> 40:39.320]  We cannot use input.
[40:39.320 --> 40:40.820]  We cannot use pivot table.
[40:40.820 --> 40:42.320]  We cannot use for.
[40:42.320 --> 40:43.820]  We cannot use next.
[40:43.820 --> 40:46.320]  These keywords cannot use.
[40:52.820 --> 40:57.320]  And then I want to ask them what would be the best practice?
[40:57.320 --> 40:59.320]  Best practice.
[40:59.320 --> 41:01.820]  And you want to use meaningful.
[41:01.820 --> 41:03.320]  Meaningful.
[41:03.320 --> 41:05.320]  Like what sheet?
[41:05.320 --> 41:06.820]  Right?
[41:07.780 --> 41:10.280]  And you see you can use the work sheet.
[41:10.280 --> 41:10.780]  Work sheet.
[41:10.780 --> 41:11.280]  Right?
[41:11.280 --> 41:12.280]  Pivot table.
[41:12.280 --> 41:13.780]  You can use Pt.
[41:13.780 --> 41:15.280]  Pivot table.
[41:15.280 --> 41:15.780]  Right?
[41:15.780 --> 41:20.280]  You can use pivot table one, pivot table two, Pt one, Pt two.
[41:20.280 --> 41:22.280]  Or work sheets one.
[41:22.280 --> 41:24.780]  Ws one, Ws two, and so on.
[41:24.780 --> 41:25.780]  Right?
[41:25.780 --> 41:31.280]  But that's how we say meaningful.
[41:37.780 --> 41:41.280]  Now next is work sheet name.
[41:41.280 --> 41:47.280]  As you just now have viewed, we want to say certain range.
[41:47.280 --> 41:49.780]  In a certain range of parameter,
[41:49.780 --> 41:53.280]  you need to have work sheets and then princesses.
[41:53.280 --> 41:56.780]  Then you use double quotes inside names.
[41:56.780 --> 41:57.780]  Right?
[41:57.780 --> 42:00.780]  That names refers to this.
[42:00.780 --> 42:05.780]  What do I have is this refers to my Excel file bottom.
[42:06.740 --> 42:08.240]  Bottom.
[42:08.240 --> 42:10.740]  And bottom bar, as you can see here,
[42:10.740 --> 42:15.740]  this refers to I have three worksheets here.
[42:15.740 --> 42:18.740]  Where is each name by this?
[42:18.740 --> 42:19.240]  Right?
[42:19.240 --> 42:21.740]  If you look at the first time work worksheet,
[42:21.740 --> 42:25.240]  it by default give you sheets one.
[42:25.240 --> 42:27.240]  Then you click another one.
[42:27.240 --> 42:30.740]  You use this to insert another new worksheet
[42:30.740 --> 42:32.240]  if it all gives you what?
[42:32.240 --> 42:33.740]  Sheets two.
[42:34.200 --> 42:36.700]  And so on by default.
[42:36.700 --> 42:39.700]  But you want to tend to your own name.
[42:39.700 --> 42:42.200]  You don't want to use the default name.
[42:42.200 --> 42:45.700]  For example, I want to have an EDA or macro.
[42:45.700 --> 42:46.700]  Right?
[42:46.700 --> 42:48.700]  Then for your assignments, you want
[42:48.700 --> 42:51.200]  to use those micro and others give.
[42:51.200 --> 42:51.700]  So on.
[42:51.700 --> 42:56.700]  So this refers to work sheet name.
[42:56.700 --> 42:58.700]  Now I also have what?
[42:58.700 --> 43:00.200]  Coding.
[43:00.200 --> 43:02.700]  Because now you write EDA code.
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.660]  And sometimes if you don't want to use the same bar,
[43:07.660 --> 43:13.660]  because you do first worksheet and you need to use work sheets.
[43:13.660 --> 43:16.660]  It's just inside the code name.
[43:16.660 --> 43:17.160]  Right?
[43:17.160 --> 43:18.660]  It's kind of long.
[43:18.660 --> 43:20.660]  And you can use coding names.
[43:25.160 --> 43:31.660]  And how do you tend to this worksheet name?
[43:32.120 --> 43:35.620]  You can click worksheet name.
[43:35.620 --> 43:38.620]  Highlight this worksheet.
[43:38.620 --> 43:47.620]  When you click means active, convicted, controllable.
[43:47.620 --> 43:52.620]  When you click on this worksheet in the product,
[43:52.620 --> 43:53.620]  it's full.
[43:53.620 --> 43:59.120]  Then you can't click the property window.
[44:00.080 --> 44:03.080]  You can change the name.
[44:03.080 --> 44:09.580]  Or you can change that by here.
[44:09.580 --> 44:16.080]  Just click here and right side click key or here.
[44:16.080 --> 44:18.080]  And it has a rename.
[44:18.080 --> 44:19.580]  You can rename there.
[44:19.580 --> 44:22.080]  You can do both way in the review code.
[44:22.080 --> 44:25.080]  Or you can even in the review code.
[44:26.040 --> 44:29.040]  You can do different ways to change the name.
[44:29.040 --> 44:33.040]  And this is referred to worksheet tab.
[44:33.040 --> 44:35.040]  What you have.
[44:35.040 --> 44:38.040]  And that's the worksheet name.
[44:38.040 --> 44:39.540]  Now we go here.
[44:39.540 --> 44:41.040]  What do we have?
[44:41.040 --> 44:46.540]  And these, as you can see here, what do you see here?
[44:46.540 --> 44:50.040]  This is the product that is full.
[44:50.040 --> 44:52.540]  And this is here?
[44:53.500 --> 44:54.000]  1, 2, 3.
[44:57.500 --> 44:59.000]  So now you can see.
[45:05.500 --> 45:09.000]  We have three works here.
[45:09.000 --> 45:13.500]  And what you see on the right side.
[45:23.500 --> 45:28.000]  You can see here.
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.500]  So the right side is what she did.
[45:32.500 --> 45:37.000]  And on the left side, now you see this is the same as that.
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.000]  If we don't change this, it will be the same as here.
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.500]  She's too confused.
[45:45.500 --> 45:46.000]  And.
[45:46.960 --> 45:56.960]  And on the right side is code V.
[45:56.960 --> 46:02.460]  And code V means if you want to say this worksheet,
[46:02.460 --> 46:04.960]  you can just use this.
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.460]  And you can just use she's one.
[46:09.460 --> 46:14.960]  And to represent that she's one with name
[46:15.920 --> 46:19.920]  of this, that's a code name.
[46:19.920 --> 46:23.920]  And code name, also you can change the code name.
[46:23.920 --> 46:25.920]  And from the pocket windows.
[46:31.920 --> 46:34.920]  And now.
[46:34.920 --> 46:39.920]  So as you can see here, what she's doing.
[46:39.920 --> 46:42.920]  Now how do you change the code name?
[46:45.920 --> 46:48.420]  You can change this code name.
[46:48.420 --> 46:48.920]  It's here.
[46:52.920 --> 46:53.920]  You click.
[46:53.920 --> 46:55.920]  Click on here.
[46:55.920 --> 46:58.420]  Click on this.
[46:58.420 --> 46:59.920]  See.
[46:59.920 --> 47:03.420]  Then the pocket window will pop.
[47:03.420 --> 47:06.420]  Then that's the window pop here.
[47:09.920 --> 47:12.420]  And that's the name here.
[47:12.420 --> 47:14.420]  You can change it.
[47:15.380 --> 47:23.880]  If currently she's three, then you just write VBA, code name.
[47:23.880 --> 47:26.380]  We didn't code the name yet.
[47:26.380 --> 47:28.880]  So.
[47:28.880 --> 47:30.380]  So you click on here.
[47:30.380 --> 47:33.380]  And then wait for it.
[47:33.380 --> 47:35.880]  If it doesn't show in this, you can always
[47:35.880 --> 47:39.380]  click the pocket window that you want to show.
[47:39.380 --> 47:43.880]  So you can change it from here.
[47:44.840 --> 47:52.340]  And that's how we can change this.
[47:52.340 --> 48:01.340]  And so now, you have two names to specify what she's.
[48:01.340 --> 48:04.840]  You can specify with code name.
[48:04.840 --> 48:09.840]  And code name can be changed in pocket windows.
[48:09.840 --> 48:13.840]  And what she's needs, then you can change it
[48:14.800 --> 48:23.300]  from the worksheet pop on the work sheets there on the pop.
[48:23.300 --> 48:24.300]  Not here.
[48:24.300 --> 48:25.300]  Not here.
[48:25.300 --> 48:27.800]  Because the spreadsheet is water.
[48:27.800 --> 48:29.300]  Right click.
[48:29.300 --> 48:31.800]  And change.
[48:31.800 --> 48:39.280]  So that's what we have for the worksheet.
[48:40.220 --> 48:42.720]  Now, let's build in function.
[48:42.720 --> 48:45.220]  Building constant.
[48:45.220 --> 48:53.220]  And building constant are really useful and save us time.
[48:53.220 --> 48:57.220]  And you have a lot of them.
[48:57.220 --> 49:02.720]  And the dialog box, message box, and the input box.
[49:02.720 --> 49:04.720]  These are dialog box.
[49:04.720 --> 49:07.220]  And they'll be OK.
[49:07.660 --> 49:12.660]  And as long as you get these up, the constant and the border,
[49:12.660 --> 49:19.660]  you can also control the border of your cell or bench
[49:19.660 --> 49:22.660]  on five meters.
[49:22.660 --> 49:26.160]  Then also, you can control the color.
[49:26.160 --> 49:29.660]  And so navigation, as I was saying,
[49:29.660 --> 49:32.160]  if you want to select, if you want to do something,
[49:32.160 --> 49:34.660]  you can select a bench.
[49:35.600 --> 49:38.100]  You can pocket first to select one cell.
[49:38.100 --> 49:41.600]  Then you use mouse to right side and down.
[49:41.600 --> 49:43.100]  Right?
[49:43.100 --> 49:46.100]  That's what you can do here.
[49:46.100 --> 49:51.100]  When you use the sorting, the sorting one,
[49:51.100 --> 49:55.100]  then you sort and you are going to get this.
[49:58.100 --> 50:03.100]  And so it's all the S1 alignment.
[50:03.540 --> 50:06.540]  And that's alignment is for format.
[50:06.540 --> 50:12.540]  If I have so many later here, I want to align them in the center.
[50:12.540 --> 50:15.540]  And then that's the center.
[50:15.540 --> 50:17.040]  It's like that.
[50:17.040 --> 50:18.040]  It's still right.
[50:18.040 --> 50:21.540]  It's still top, bottom.
[50:21.540 --> 50:22.540]  And so on.
[50:22.540 --> 50:25.540]  And how do we test copy paste?
[50:25.540 --> 50:30.040]  As I mentioned, you need to paste values.
[50:30.480 --> 50:34.480]  You need a lot of volume, so you need to do this.
[50:34.480 --> 50:37.480]  Unless you paste the volume and so on.
[50:37.480 --> 50:39.480]  And pivot table.
[50:39.480 --> 50:42.980]  These are the four pivot table constants,
[50:42.980 --> 50:45.480]  which are very useful.
[50:45.480 --> 50:48.480]  We talked about after 15.
[50:48.480 --> 50:51.480]  And we would use these.
[50:51.480 --> 50:56.480]  And so we will say how to ascend in quality here.
[50:56.920 --> 50:59.920]  So these constants are very useful.
[51:06.420 --> 51:09.920]  Now, this is building functions.
[51:09.920 --> 51:12.920]  Just now, it's building constant.
[51:12.920 --> 51:15.920]  I have building function.
[51:15.920 --> 51:17.920]  And building function, we have message box
[51:17.920 --> 51:21.420]  and we interact with user.
[51:21.860 --> 51:29.360]  And first, we're going to talk about message box.
[51:29.360 --> 51:31.860]  So message box.
[51:31.860 --> 51:36.860]  And as you can see here, you can use this message box
[51:36.860 --> 51:42.360]  and prompt, buttons, title.
[51:42.360 --> 51:44.860]  And the title means the box.
[51:44.860 --> 51:46.360]  What is the title?
[51:46.800 --> 51:49.800]  Button means it's OK or cancel.
[51:49.800 --> 51:52.800]  OK, cancel, different options.
[51:52.800 --> 51:56.800]  But you only need these.
[51:56.800 --> 51:58.800]  It's required because you are going
[51:58.800 --> 52:02.800]  to pop up what you want.
[52:02.800 --> 52:06.800]  These are the options.
[52:06.800 --> 52:11.300]  And you can do with this solo.
[52:11.300 --> 52:15.800]  And you can without this.
[52:16.740 --> 52:19.240]  Without, it's still OK.
[52:19.240 --> 52:22.740]  But in this is the case, the result returned.
[52:22.740 --> 52:24.740]  You can see here.
[52:24.740 --> 52:29.740]  Sometimes we want to see maybe we give the message box.
[52:29.740 --> 52:34.740]  If the message box has OK, cancel,
[52:34.740 --> 52:38.740]  or ignore different selection, different results,
[52:38.740 --> 52:42.240]  we want to see how user respond.
[52:42.240 --> 52:45.240]  So that means you need to know the results.
[52:46.180 --> 52:49.180]  And so that means you need to know the return.
[52:49.180 --> 52:53.680]  In that case, and here this case is just one of these three
[52:53.680 --> 52:54.180]  results.
[52:54.180 --> 52:59.680]  You don't care about how they reply.
[52:59.680 --> 53:05.680]  Here is, and I wanted to see, what do they reply?
[53:05.680 --> 53:09.680]  Do they click OK or do they click cancel?
[53:09.680 --> 53:13.180]  And so you want to have something here
[53:13.620 --> 53:17.120]  equal to what?
[53:17.120 --> 53:20.620]  And in this case, this is how to.
[53:20.620 --> 53:23.120]  You have to put it in this case.
[53:23.120 --> 53:24.120]  You might.
[53:24.120 --> 53:26.120]  Maybe you need to have this.
[53:26.120 --> 53:30.120]  But now, you want to see what would be the response?
[53:30.120 --> 53:31.620]  How do I know?
[53:31.620 --> 53:33.120]  And click OK.
[53:33.120 --> 53:35.620]  Will that give the answer OK?
[53:35.620 --> 53:36.620]  Or cancel?
[53:36.620 --> 53:43.120]  No, actually, they use constant number to express that.
[53:44.060 --> 53:49.560]  And so that's the reason now when you do this,
[53:49.560 --> 53:53.560]  you see here we have an integer value instead of saying
[53:53.560 --> 53:56.560]  that it's really an integer.
[53:56.560 --> 53:59.560]  So in here, when you use results,
[53:59.560 --> 54:03.560]  you have to declare results as integers, right?
[54:03.560 --> 54:09.560]  Because you expect to have an integer returned, right?
[54:09.560 --> 54:12.060]  Because you have to match both.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.500]  If you don't know, then it just means alert.
[54:16.500 --> 54:17.000]  Right?
[54:17.000 --> 54:17.500]  In that case.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.500]  OK.
[54:21.500 --> 54:24.500]  So these are the statements you can
[54:24.500 --> 54:32.500]  find out because all teachers have OK, OK, cancel.
[54:32.500 --> 54:36.500]  And these are the options you can use.
[54:36.500 --> 54:39.500]  Now, a different answer corresponds
[54:39.940 --> 54:42.940]  to a different response.
[54:42.940 --> 54:43.940]  We got here.
[54:43.940 --> 54:44.940]  That's the value.
[54:44.940 --> 54:47.940]  If you click on OK, then it just gives you what?
[54:47.940 --> 54:53.440]  So let's say the return.
[54:53.440 --> 54:53.940]  Right?
[54:53.940 --> 54:56.440]  So for message box, without return,
[54:56.440 --> 54:58.940]  you don't need to have the princesses.
[54:58.940 --> 55:03.440]  But if you have and then you do the return states.
[55:04.380 --> 55:05.880]  Right?
[55:05.880 --> 55:10.380]  So now, next, you can see here.
[55:13.380 --> 55:16.880]  This is a simple example.
[55:16.880 --> 55:21.380]  Declare output as integer.
[55:21.380 --> 55:23.880]  Now, for example, these.
[55:23.880 --> 55:29.380]  Now, because I wanted to have return, right?
[55:29.820 --> 55:34.320]  So message box of these.
[55:34.320 --> 55:35.820]  You are.
[55:35.820 --> 55:41.820]  So this will show the shoe here.
[55:41.820 --> 55:46.820]  And this prompt and buttons and the title.
[55:46.820 --> 55:52.320]  And if this is the sixth, then great.
[55:52.320 --> 55:55.320]  And sixth corresponds, yes.
[55:55.760 --> 55:59.760]  Then it will prompt this.
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.760]  Otherwise, it will say, you are just not expert.
[56:04.760 --> 56:07.260]  And then, eval.print.
[56:07.260 --> 56:08.760]  Eval.print.
[56:08.760 --> 56:10.260]  Eval.print.
[56:10.260 --> 56:12.760]  Vpy.yes.
[56:12.760 --> 56:14.760]  Vpy.yes.
[56:14.760 --> 56:17.260]  Vpy.yes is a number, right?
[56:17.260 --> 56:22.760]  I will use processes from previous slides.
[56:22.760 --> 56:23.760]  Right?
[56:24.700 --> 56:28.700]  So in what shoe in what window, when I have these,
[56:28.700 --> 56:31.200]  what does that mean?
[56:31.200 --> 56:33.200]  Eval.print.
[56:33.200 --> 56:36.200]  In what shoe in what?
[56:36.200 --> 56:36.700]  Where?
[56:36.700 --> 56:38.200]  You see that.
[56:38.200 --> 56:39.700]  Ones.
[56:39.700 --> 56:42.200]  Yes, in which shoe, one center.
[56:42.200 --> 56:46.700]  But in what shoe, whenever you see eval.print,
[56:46.700 --> 56:51.200]  in what shoe in immediate, when not?
[56:51.200 --> 56:52.700]  Smalls.
[56:53.640 --> 56:56.640]  Immediate window.
[56:56.640 --> 56:58.140]  Immediate window.
[56:58.140 --> 57:01.640]  You have the default methods by what shoe in the video.
[57:07.140 --> 57:09.640]  OK.
[57:09.640 --> 57:13.140]  And so, in some of these.
[57:13.140 --> 57:16.640]  And so whenever you execute this,
[57:16.640 --> 57:19.140]  they will show you here, right?
[57:19.140 --> 57:22.640]  And five more.
[57:23.580 --> 57:24.580]  And a button.
[57:24.580 --> 57:28.580]  A little button, and this is prompt.
[57:28.580 --> 57:32.580]  And if you answer yes, it will go in this.
[57:32.580 --> 57:35.580]  It will go in no, it will go in this.
[57:35.580 --> 57:38.080]  Just here, you can see.
[57:40.080 --> 57:44.080]  Now, if you see here, you don't have these.
[57:44.080 --> 57:44.580]  Right?
[57:44.580 --> 57:47.080]  Empty, leave empty for the buttons.
[57:47.080 --> 57:51.580]  If you have empty, by default, it will just give you OK.
[57:52.520 --> 57:54.020]  You just OK.
[57:54.020 --> 57:54.520]  You see here?
[57:54.520 --> 57:57.020]  But here you have maybe yes, no.
[57:57.020 --> 58:01.020]  Means you have yes, no, two buttons.
[58:01.020 --> 58:03.020]  So different buttons is different.
[58:03.020 --> 58:05.020]  And if you're OK, you can ignore,
[58:05.020 --> 58:10.020]  you can't wait, but just leave empty space here.
[58:10.020 --> 58:12.520]  Right?
[58:12.520 --> 58:15.020]  And eval.print, it will show you.
[58:15.020 --> 58:17.020]  When I say here eval.print, you're
[58:17.460 --> 58:19.460]  going to ignore it in the prompt.
[58:19.460 --> 58:22.960]  But you need to use the S of that.
[58:22.960 --> 58:23.460]  Right?
[58:23.460 --> 58:27.960]  And that is this.
[58:27.960 --> 58:35.460]  When you have the blocks, you also can show the,
[58:35.460 --> 58:38.460]  you can also use this.
[58:38.460 --> 58:42.960]  You see here, maybe yes, no.
[58:43.400 --> 58:46.900]  Plus expression.
[58:46.900 --> 58:51.400]  You can plus exclamation, make reverse sign,
[58:51.400 --> 58:56.900]  make question sign, make exclamation, evalation.
[58:56.900 --> 59:02.400]  So you can get more resourceful.
[59:02.400 --> 59:05.400]  And you can use this plus to show you
[59:05.400 --> 59:12.900]  two different icons in your message box.
[59:13.340 --> 59:17.840]  And now, when I say next is, if I write a long sentence,
[59:17.840 --> 59:19.840]  what can I do with this?
[59:19.840 --> 59:22.840]  Sometimes I look up the message and I always
[59:22.840 --> 59:24.340]  name it or feel it.
[59:24.340 --> 59:25.840]  It's a long one.
[59:25.840 --> 59:27.340]  Then you need to work.
[59:27.340 --> 59:30.340]  You always use this type of space
[59:30.340 --> 59:32.840]  followed by an underscroll.
[59:32.840 --> 59:33.840]  You see here?
[59:33.840 --> 59:36.340]  This one is a speech, this is an underscroll.
[59:36.340 --> 59:40.840]  So that corresponds to one sentence.
[59:41.280 --> 59:41.780]  Right?
[59:45.280 --> 59:48.780]  As you execute space, underscroll.
[59:48.780 --> 59:52.280]  You use this to look for the next line.
[59:52.280 --> 59:54.780]  And here.
[59:54.780 --> 59:57.280]  All right?
[59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.280]  So that's how you break a sentence.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.780]  Now, so we just learned the message box.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:09.280]  The message box, M-S-T-P-O-S.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.780]  The message box.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.720]  Next is input box.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720]  Input box.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.220]  Just use input box.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:21.220]  Now, as you see here, input box normally
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:24.720]  refers to you want as a user.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:31.220]  Because you want to let a user to do input.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.220]  When I say, what's your name?
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.220]  What's your name?
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.220]  You're appearing in the front.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.220]  What's your name, right?
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.220]  So you want to get information.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.660]  That means you need to have a return, right?
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:50.160]  And to prompt the type of default,
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.660]  by looking for the default value.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:56.160]  These are the options that we've compiled.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.660]  And so because it has a return, you
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:03.160]  do need to have a parenthesis.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.660]  Now, also, by default, it returns a string value.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.220]  To this my value.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.220]  Right?
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:17.220]  And now, that's how we write here.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:21.700]  For example, I have these input box.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:24.700]  Enter the name, then the name.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.700]  This is title, and the input box.
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:30.200]  Message box, title.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.700]  And here's the message box.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.200]  You see here?
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.700]  Enter name.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.200]  And you see here, title.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.680]  So on the top, always, like here,
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:50.160]  is prompt into your family name by default, like here.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:50.660]  Wait.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.660]  This might be a bit big.
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:56.160]  And so that's how we have.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.160]  And this, after you go here, and after you do this,
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.660]  then you're going to have this string information given
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.160]  to my family.
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:14.120]  That's how you get the resource of information.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.620]  Right?
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:19.120]  So I call a prompt default value.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.120]  If you don't put a default value,
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.620]  then it will leave empty.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:43.580]  Then what if, as we said, it will return the value input
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.580]  and there, and you have to match, right?
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.580]  And on the left, my value, and that type
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:56.080]  will see it as the right side returned.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.540]  So I want to use to declare this as a string.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:07.040]  It has to return a string information.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.040]  Now, what if you don't know?

[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.540]  For the data, I want to put a data not string.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:17.540]  And you can put here, my value as a parent,
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:22.040]  such that it will give you if this data is an integer,
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.540]  it will give you an integer.
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:24.040]  Right?
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:31.540]  And now, without showing the title,
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:36.540]  you see here, leave empty in the middle.
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.040]  So here, all the issues will be solved.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.040]  Microsoft will be solved.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.040]  And what if I have these?
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.540]  But if you don't have this default option,
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.040]  you just don't need that.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.040]  So you may have two, you don't have three.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:02.000]  So that's how you do the input box.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.500]  OK?
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:13.000]  Then next, and format functions, and format functions.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  Format functions.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  And we have format as if you click the sale on the right side,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.500]  you can see format for sale.
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:32.960]  And custom is available types you can do in here.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.460]  So how do we do that?
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.460]  These are the options.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.460]  How do we do that?
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.960]  We can do it in this way.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.460]  Format.
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:46.460]  So that's format.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:47.960]  Is it here?
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.960]  This is the number.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.960]  I want it to format this number.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.420]  But if you don't have this number, you have variable.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.920]  That's OK, right?
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.920]  Because you hold the numbers.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.920]  Then you have these.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.920]  That's the number, by double quote.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.420]  That's the type of here.
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:09.920]  And this here, this is for custom, but also here,
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.920]  for numbering, you have two digits.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.920]  And we have different digits.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.920]  Right?
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.420]  And so that's the sentence you can do.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.380]  And then the percentage of my here,
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.380]  we have the percentage of.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:27.380]  And these are for the year old.
[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:29.380]  And also we can do for the date.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.380]  Right?
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:34.380]  Different options we can do here.
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:38.380]  You see here, I have debug.print.
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:45.380]  And then that results will show just a VBA edge window.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:49.340]  And then you will see the results.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.340]  The result is final.
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.340]  And you can debug.
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.340]  All right.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.340]  And next is the string.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.340]  And strings.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:09.340]  Strings.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.340]  Strings, when we declare, it just
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:17.300]  string, and message is equal to this.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:22.300]  Then we can use this variable name for the message box.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.300]  Right?
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.300]  The message box, if you look here,
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.300]  did I use the princesses?
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.300]  No, I didn't.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.300]  Because of what?
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.300]  I don't want to return.
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.300]  I don't need to return.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.300]  If you don't need to return, you don't
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:39.300]  need to have that princesses.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.260]  So the result will be the Christmas
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:44.260]  box for this year.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.260]  Hello.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.260]  Hello, which is here.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.260]  Hi.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.260]  And here is prompt.
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.260]  Prompt is here.
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:55.260]  And that's OK.
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:03.260]  Now, if you want, I want to say more.
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.260]  We have two explanations.
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.260]  And it's Amazon.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:13.220]  So if I say, OK, I want to have this message.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.220]  I want to cry.
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:19.220]  You guys, on your course instruction,
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:20.220]  so cry, you guys.
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:23.220]  But in the future, you need to use the space
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.220]  to separate, to separate.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.220]  Right?
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.220]  So you just use this.
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.220]  It's Amazon.
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:30.220]  Right.
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:33.220]  So that's how you connect.
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.220]  Incarnate.
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.220]  Your strings is Amazon.
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:42.220]  And that's it.
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.220]  That's how you do.
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:48.220]  And now, the message box is showing this.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:49.220]  Then next.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:54.220]  And this one is the two important things here now.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.220]  For the string functions, because we really
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:59.220]  need to do the strings a lot.
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:02.220]  You want to take the strings, take
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.220]  the information about the strings.
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.220]  So really, and you have left and the right.
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.180]  Is this string.
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.180]  You're starting from the left.
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.180]  You want to take five letters.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.180]  See here.
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:17.180]  You want to start from right side taking five.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.180]  Right.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:21.180]  So you have two strings.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.180]  And how many right?
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.180]  The left.
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:29.180]  And then on the middle, it means you
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:33.180]  don't need to take from the first left or right.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:37.180]  You have to take from this middle part.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.140]  The string.
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:40.140]  Start.
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:41.140]  Start from number three.
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:42.140]  One, two, three.
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:43.140]  So you start from three.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.140]  Take five.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.140]  That's how you have.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.140]  And how long is the string?
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:54.140]  That's one, two, three, four, five.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.140]  How long?
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.140]  And then you case.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.140]  So you know, up case.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.140]  Lower case.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.140]  Up, lower.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.140]  Somebody you want to uniform.
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.140]  You want everything to be the same.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.100]  A lot of cases you can replace.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.100]  A lot of cases you can replace.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:16.100]  For example, this is a region on the string.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.100]  I want to replace.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.100]  I want to delete actually this one.

[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:24.100]  So I can replace this, the character in which
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:28.100]  you want double quote together.
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:31.100]  So that means I want to delete that.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.100]  Right.
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.100]  This is empty.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.100]  But if you have double quote and have a space,
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.060]  then it becomes A, space B.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.060]  Right.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.060]  So that's how you do it.
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:42.060]  Here now I don't have anything.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:45.060]  And then so on.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:51.060]  And also you can find the spatial character's position.
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.060]  You can return the position.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.060]  So by this, all return for the character.
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:10:00.060]  Now is for the position.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.060]  And then where is the spatial character position?
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:10.020]  So that's which position you want to start your spatial.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:15.020]  And that's where it means you start it from here.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:19.020]  When you go to the fourth fight, you see this one.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:22.020]  If you don't have that, that's terrible.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:26.020]  And some of these are also useful.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:29.020]  You can cast them here.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.020]  That's what is spring.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.020]  That's what is spring.
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:38.980]  Well, that's all for today.
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.980]  So today we learned a lot.
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:44.980]  I'll continue in the next.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.980]  So see you guys next week.

Detected language: English
[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  But because I do not want to be any more delayed, maybe what I'll do is I will record myself,
[00:08.000 --> 00:15.000]  like I said on Monday, I'll put it on my learning stage, you watch that before next class, and
[00:15.000 --> 00:19.000]  then I will do a little bit because I'm not supposed to be recording myself.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  Okay?
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.000]  Between you and me.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.000]  Okay?
[00:22.000 --> 00:30.000]  And then hopefully I will be like on stage, like working with other instructors on the
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  trackers.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  So I don't want to do it at the very end.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  I could just keep doing it, but then at the very end you will get too overwhelmed and
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  you'll be like, oh my god, there's so much I have to now watch a video and I have to
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  study for the test and I don't want that.
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.000]  Okay?
[00:42.000 --> 00:43.000]  Alright.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  So we were talking about personality and we talked about the strength and weakness.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  So I want to bring to your attention this particular study.
[00:53.000 --> 00:54.000]  Okay?
[00:54.000 --> 01:01.000]  So this is just to show you that there is research to back up on our personality.
[01:01.000 --> 01:02.000]  Okay?
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  So this was done by Barrick and Mell in 1993.
[01:06.000 --> 01:16.000]  And so basically what they did was they conducted a study where they examined the role of autonomy
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  in a relationship.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  And that relationship was basically conscientiousness and job performance.
[01:23.000 --> 01:24.000]  Okay?
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  So you'll learn about conscientiousness in a few minutes, but what's enough?
[01:28.000 --> 01:29.000]  Autonomy.
[01:29.000 --> 01:38.000]  So autonomy basically is the extent to which a job provides you with freedom, with independence,
[01:38.000 --> 01:46.000]  with discretion in terms of things like scheduling work, determining the procedures to be used,
[01:46.000 --> 01:47.000]  and so forth.
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.000]  Okay?
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  So autonomy is basically having the freedom to do what we want to do.
[01:51.000 --> 01:52.000]  Okay?
[01:52.000 --> 02:02.000]  So as you can imagine, high autonomy is consistent with the notion of which one of the two?
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  Is it a weak or a strong situation?
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  This is how we have had to find a weak and a strong.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  So where do you think high autonomy, which is having more freedom, will be more prominent?
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  Prominent.
[02:22.000 --> 02:23.000]  In a weak situation.
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  In a weak situation.
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.000]  Why is that?
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  Because there's less rules, less pressure, so you have more freedom.
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.000]  Exactly.
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.000]  Good.
[02:32.000 --> 02:33.000]  What is your name again?
[02:33.000 --> 02:34.000]  Mona.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  Mona, okay.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  So just remind me of your name again.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.000]  Okay?
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  All right.
[02:38.000 --> 02:46.000]  So low autonomy, more or consistent with weak situation, and then low autonomy is more
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  consistent with the notion of a strong situation.
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.000]  Right?
[02:50.000 --> 02:51.000]  Okay.
[02:51.000 --> 03:02.000]  So conscientiousness is basically, so I'll talk about this in a few minutes, but conscientiousness
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  has to do with how hardworking you are or how dependable you are.
[03:07.000 --> 03:08.000]  Right?
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  So these are some of the adjectives I go with conscientiousness.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  So what do you think would happen?
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.000]  First of all, the more, the higher the conscientiousness, the less or more likely you are to perform
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.000]  well.
[03:24.000 --> 03:25.000]  What do you think?
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.000]  More.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.000]  More, right?
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.000]  Yes.
[03:29.000 --> 03:36.000]  So there is a positive correlation or relationship between conscientiousness and performance.
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  Name again.
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  Mustafa.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  Mustafa.
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  Okay.
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  All right.
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  So what is it that they found?
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  Okay.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  So they brought in a new variable which was autonomy, and what is it that they found?
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  So they found that in low autonomy situations, okay, there was essentially no relationship
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  between conscientiousness and performance.
[04:01.000 --> 04:02.000]  Okay.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  That's what you see on there.
[04:04.000 --> 04:11.000]  So in such situations, basically what that means is that the rules, the rules, the procedures,
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  it was quite defined, right?
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  And so, what is that?
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  What is that?
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  That alacrino, right?
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  Oh.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  I don't know what that is.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  I was just saying, oh no, what did I do?
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  Oh, you need to tell me because I'm mute.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  Okay.100.69.197.53 - - [17/Sep/2025 17:09:42] "GET /status/22 HTTP/1.1" 200 -

[04:33.000 --> 04:40.000]  So they're well defined, and so then there is little room for individual to really express
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  his or her personality.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  But in high autonomy, which is what you see in the solid, what do they find?
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.000]  They actually find that strong relationship between conscientiousness and job performance,
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  right?
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  So the situation is weak, right?
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  Roles are less loosely defined.
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  There are few rules, right?
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  And so basically, you see performance go up.
[05:11.000 --> 05:12.000]  Okay.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  So bottom line, I will never ask you this on a test, first of all, but I want to demonstrate
[05:17.000 --> 05:28.000]  to you using a research study that personality really does have a strong effect in weak situations.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  Okay?
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  Does that make sense?
[05:31.000 --> 05:32.000]  Yes?
[05:32.000 --> 05:33.000]  Okay.
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.000]  All right.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.000]  Good.
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  All right.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  So how do we go about testing personality?
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  Well, there are two different ways in which you can do this, okay?
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  There is self-report, and then there is observation.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  Okay.
[05:50.000 --> 05:57.000]  So self-report basically is sort of like what I had you do in a clinic.
[05:57.000 --> 06:03.000]  Remember on Monday I said, would you mind completing this scale, right?
[06:03.000 --> 06:09.000]  So you respond to a question or a couple of questions using a Likert scale, which is the
[06:09.000 --> 06:12.000]  scale that you saw, that self-report, right?
[06:13.000 --> 06:17.000]  Observational is where someone describes you.
[06:19.000 --> 06:20.000]  Okay.
[06:20.000 --> 06:25.000]  So basically, you would see this in a job situation.
[06:25.000 --> 06:26.000]  Okay.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  In a job interview, what is it that they're doing?
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  Someone is asking you questions, right?
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  So they're noticing your behavior.
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  They're rating your responses.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  They're trying to figure out what kind of a person you are, right?
[06:40.000 --> 06:45.000]  They're trying to ask themselves, do we actually want this person based on the personality
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  that they're demonstrating, right?
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  Is this person a good fit for this particular job based on what we see?
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.000]  Okay.
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.000]  So those are the two different ways in which you can assess personality.
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.000]  But as you can just imagine, both of them have their pros and cons, right?
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  So for example, self-report, what might we see?
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.000]  We can see people pick.
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.000]  Oh yeah, sorry, go on.
[07:12.000 --> 07:13.000]  Sure, I'll ask the question.
[07:13.000 --> 07:14.000]  What would you?
[07:14.000 --> 07:15.000]  Yes?
[07:15.000 --> 07:16.000]  Bias.
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.000]  Bias.
[07:17.000 --> 07:18.000]  With what sense?
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  I think you want to create a better life.
[07:20.000 --> 07:21.000]  Yeah, right?
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.000]  So it's not, that's called social desirability.
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.000]  Okay?
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  So you're kind of presenting yourself, or impression management.
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  You're trying to present yourself in a positive light, in a way that the other person might
[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000]  want to see.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  I think it was Rayman.
[07:38.000 --> 07:39.000]  Yeah.
[07:39.000 --> 07:40.000]  Rayman.
[07:40.000 --> 07:41.000]  Rayman.
[07:43.000 --> 07:44.000]  Albert.
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  Albert, Rayman, Aaron.
[07:48.000 --> 07:49.000]  Yep.
[07:49.000 --> 07:50.000]  Great.
[07:50.000 --> 07:51.000]  Go on.
[07:51.000 --> 07:52.000]  Go on.
[07:52.000 --> 07:53.000]  Janine.
[07:53.000 --> 07:54.000]  Erica.
[07:54.000 --> 07:55.000]  Yep.
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.000]  Good.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  Har something.
[07:57.000 --> 07:58.000]  Yeah.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  What did you put again?
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.000]  Harky rap.
[08:02.000 --> 08:03.000]  Harky rap.
[08:03.000 --> 08:04.000]  Yeah.
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.000]  And then the opposite was on?
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.000]  By character.
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.000]  No, opposite, but similar.
[08:07.000 --> 08:08.000]  Similar.
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  Haricum.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.000]  Haricum.

[09:05.000 --> 09:06.000]  Zoher.
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.000]  You said no.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.000]  Errors.
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.000]  Errors.
[09:09.000 --> 09:10.000]  Okay.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  Anyway, I'll change the names.
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.000]  I'll change the names.
[09:12.000 --> 09:13.000]  Okay.
[09:13.000 --> 09:14.000]  All right.
[09:14.000 --> 09:15.000]  Okay.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  So what might other people think?
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  They might think it.
[09:17.000 --> 09:18.000]  Right?
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.000]  So social desirability, impression management, thinking it.
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  And with alterational thinking, right?
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.000]  Yeah.
[09:21.000 --> 09:22.000]  Yeah.
[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  Yeah.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.000]  Yeah.
[09:24.000 --> 09:25.000]  Yeah.
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.000]  Yeah.
[09:26.000 --> 09:27.000]  Yeah.
[09:27.000 --> 09:28.000]  Yeah.
[09:28.000 --> 09:29.000]  Yeah.
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  Yeah.
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.000]  Yeah.
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.000]  So, thinking, right?
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.440]  Like, you might be even a certain, when we go for our job interviews, we're putting our

[09:36.440 --> 09:38.800]  best foot forward, but are we really like that?
[09:38.800 --> 09:39.800]  Is the question, right?
[09:39.800 --> 09:40.800]  Probably not.
[09:40.800 --> 09:41.800]  Right?
[09:41.800 --> 09:42.800]  Okay.
[09:42.800 --> 09:45.800]  So, but there are positive things to it too, right?
[09:45.800 --> 09:51.280]  Like the self-report, for example, you are the person that knows yourself the best.
[09:51.280 --> 09:59.880]  So if you answer in an honest way, you know yourself the best way possible, right?
[10:00.880 --> 10:05.880]  So, and observational, remember what I said, personality is like your social reputation,
[10:05.880 --> 10:06.880]  right?
[10:06.880 --> 10:13.880]  But someone close to you would know how to observe you accurately as opposed to someone
[10:13.880 --> 10:14.880]  not.
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.880]  So anyway, regardless, both of these procedures are used, and we actually say that when it
[10:19.880 --> 10:22.880]  comes to personality, use both of them.
[10:22.880 --> 10:23.880]  Okay?
[10:23.880 --> 10:24.880]  All right.
[10:24.880 --> 10:26.880]  So I had you complete the skill.
[10:26.880 --> 10:29.880]  Okay, we got the opportunity to do it, right?
[10:29.880 --> 10:34.880]  We have like five, what's the word I'm looking for?
[10:34.880 --> 10:38.880]  Whole numbers for the five different dimensions.
[10:38.880 --> 10:39.880]  Okay.
[10:39.880 --> 10:48.880]  So what I had you complete was one of the most popular or one of the most widely accepted
[10:48.880 --> 10:50.880]  trait models that are out there.
[10:50.880 --> 10:53.880]  And this is known as the big five, okay?
[10:53.880 --> 10:58.880]  So definitely understand what the big five comprises of, okay?
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.880]  Also, go to your textbook, because I remember seeing a multiple choice on the big five.
[11:04.880 --> 11:09.880]  Go to your textbook and just read up on the big five, as in like more than what I have
[11:09.880 --> 11:10.880]  written on here.
[11:10.880 --> 11:15.880]  Yeah, I don't quite remember what it was, but it was like, oh, I don't remember teaching
[11:15.880 --> 11:18.880]  this, but I'm going to tell my students to do it anyway, okay?
[11:19.880 --> 11:22.880]  Because it was like some stat, like some stat.
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.880]  So just go to the textbook on the big five and just like skim through it, okay?
[11:27.880 --> 11:30.880]  All right, but I'll give you more closer to the 10.
[11:30.880 --> 11:32.880]  Okay, so let's talk about the big five, okay?
[11:32.880 --> 11:37.880]  This is also known as the five factor model of personality.
[11:37.880 --> 11:43.880]  So big five, five factor, obviously that means they're five dimensions, okay?
[11:43.880 --> 11:45.880]  So they're five dimensions of personality.
[11:45.880 --> 11:47.880]  So what are they?
[11:47.880 --> 11:49.880]  It's what you see on the top.
[11:49.880 --> 11:55.880]  Extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience,
[11:55.880 --> 11:56.880]  okay?
[11:56.880 --> 12:03.880]  And I will tell you what each of them corresponds to over the next few slides.
[12:03.880 --> 12:09.880]  But in a nutshell, extraversion has to do with how sociable, positive you are versus
[12:09.880 --> 12:11.880]  how withdrawn or shy.
[12:11.880 --> 12:15.880]  Okay, I acknowledge that this can be very difficult to remember, right?
[12:15.880 --> 12:16.880]  That's a lot.
[12:16.880 --> 12:19.880]  So you know me, you know I love acronyms.
[12:19.880 --> 12:23.880]  So the acronym that I'm going to use is Canoe, okay?
[12:23.880 --> 12:26.880]  So what does Canoe stand for?
[12:26.880 --> 12:32.880]  The C stands for Consciousness, Impulsive, and Unimaginative.
[12:32.880 --> 12:35.880]  Okay, so this is one of the big five.
[12:35.880 --> 12:37.880]  So let's talk about the big five.
[12:37.880 --> 12:39.880]  So this is a very important one.
[12:39.880 --> 12:43.880]  So this is a very important one because that's what we're going to do today.
[12:43.880 --> 12:45.880]  So let's look at the big five, right?
[12:45.880 --> 12:47.880]  Okay, so what does Canoe stand for?
[12:47.880 --> 12:56.880]  The C stands for Conscientiousness, A is for Agreeableness, N is for Neuroticism, which
[12:56.880 --> 13:01.880]  is actually the opposite of emotional stability, okay?
[13:01.880 --> 13:06.880]  O is for Openness to Experience, and then E is for Extraversion.
[13:06.880 --> 13:09.880]  So as you can see, I love nature, right?
[13:09.880 --> 13:16.880]  My expectations had to do with air, and now I'm introducing you to water, okay, with this
[13:16.880 --> 13:17.880]  canoe thing.
[13:17.880 --> 13:18.880]  Make sense?
[13:18.880 --> 13:20.880]  No one laughed at that, you good joke?
[13:20.880 --> 13:22.880]  Okay, no problem.
[13:22.880 --> 13:25.880]  All right, we're moving along.
[13:25.880 --> 13:31.880]  Okay, a few important things to keep in mind when it comes to the big five model, okay?
[13:31.880 --> 13:36.880]  The first is that it is efficient, okay?
[13:36.880 --> 13:43.880]  So the basic premise of this model is that the entire scope of human personality can
[13:43.880 --> 13:51.880]  be efficiently described with these relatively independent five dimensions, okay?
[13:51.880 --> 13:57.880]  The second is that it is based on factor analysis.
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.880]  Now this is a concept that you will learn further in your career, like further, probably
[14:02.880 --> 14:08.880]  if you're taking an advanced level math course, or maybe if you're going to graduate studies.
[14:08.880 --> 14:10.880]  But what does that mean?
[14:10.880 --> 14:12.880]  What does factor analysis mean?
[14:12.880 --> 14:17.880]  Okay, so when we started off this research, we were actually, and I'm going to look at
[14:17.880 --> 14:25.880]  my notes here because I don't want to get this wrong, 17,953 personality traits.
[14:25.880 --> 14:28.880]  That's a lot of personality traits, right?
[14:28.880 --> 14:31.880]  17,953.
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.880]  Those were reduced to 17.
[14:36.880 --> 14:37.880]  Why?
[14:37.880 --> 14:40.880]  Because they took out synonymous things and stuff like that.
[14:40.880 --> 14:47.880]  Okay, so basically how they were reduced, and they kept on getting reduced, is through
[14:47.880 --> 14:48.880]  these factor analysis.
[14:48.880 --> 14:55.880]  So factor analysis is a statistical procedure, which is what you, this is what it does.
[14:55.880 --> 15:00.880]  It lumps together related items, okay?
[15:00.880 --> 15:03.880]  So in a nutshell, that's what it did.
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.880]  So we used factor analysis, and all these related items were lumped together, and we
[15:08.880 --> 15:10.880]  ended up with five dimensions.
[15:10.880 --> 15:19.880]  Otherwise, we wouldn't be dealing with 17,953 dimensions, which is a lot, all right?
[15:19.880 --> 15:20.880]  Okay.
[15:20.880 --> 15:23.880]  The third is that it is culturally robust.
[15:23.880 --> 15:35.880]  In that the five factor model can be reproduced across many cultures as well as languages.
[15:35.880 --> 15:38.880]  Okay?
[15:38.880 --> 15:46.880]  So the propensities or the factor structures or whatever you may call them, they're similar
[15:46.880 --> 15:47.880]  to the five factors.
[15:47.880 --> 15:58.880]  So you can use basically the same measure to reliably capture the personality traits
[15:58.880 --> 15:59.880]  across cultures.
[15:59.880 --> 16:12.880]  And the fourth is that there is evidence to indicate that these five factors, they're
[16:12.880 --> 16:16.880]  They're heritable and they're stable.
[16:16.880 --> 16:17.880]  Okay?
[16:17.880 --> 16:21.880]  So I've already kind of spoken a little bit about how personality can be a function of
[16:21.880 --> 16:22.880]  our genes, right?
[16:22.880 --> 16:25.880]  As well as the environment.
[16:25.880 --> 16:30.880]  So that stays the case here too, but it's also stable.

[16:30.880 --> 16:34.880]  So you tend to demonstrate the same personality.
[16:34.880 --> 16:40.880]  Yes, experience might change it over time, but for the most part, you will still demonstrate
[16:40.880 --> 16:41.880]  the same.
[16:41.880 --> 16:43.880]  Okay, makes sense?
[16:43.880 --> 16:44.880]  Yes?
[16:44.880 --> 16:45.880]  Okay.
[16:45.880 --> 16:49.880]  So now let's talk about Canute in a little bit more detail.
[16:49.880 --> 16:52.880]  So let's first talk about extraversion.
[16:52.880 --> 16:59.880]  So extraversion really has to do with the comfort level with relationships.
[16:59.880 --> 17:00.880]  Okay?
[17:00.880 --> 17:03.880]  It has to do with how sociable you are.
[17:03.880 --> 17:10.880]  One of the things I want to mention on here.
[17:10.880 --> 17:17.880]  So before I get into that, here's the thing that I want you to know.
[17:17.880 --> 17:20.880]  So extroverted people, right?
[17:20.880 --> 17:23.880]  They tend to prioritize status striving.
[17:23.880 --> 17:25.880]  So write that down somewhere.
[17:25.880 --> 17:27.880]  Status striving.
[17:27.880 --> 17:28.880]  Okay?
[17:28.880 --> 17:33.880]  So extroversion equals status striving.
[17:33.880 --> 17:36.880]  So what is status striving?
[17:36.880 --> 17:42.880]  Status striving is a strong desire to obtain power and influence.
[17:42.880 --> 17:44.880]  Okay?
[17:44.880 --> 17:46.880]  Within a social structure.
[17:46.880 --> 17:55.880]  So it's not surprising that a lot of our leaders, whether you're looking at the groups that
[17:55.880 --> 18:02.880]  you're assigned to or whether you're looking at the nation or whatever it may be, that
[18:02.880 --> 18:06.880]  a lot of our leaders are extroverted individuals.
[18:06.880 --> 18:07.880]  Okay?
[18:07.880 --> 18:09.880]  Makes sense?
[18:09.880 --> 18:10.880]  Okay.
[18:10.880 --> 18:21.880]  So if you score low on this, then you are typically referred to as an introvert.
[18:21.880 --> 18:22.880]  Okay?
[18:22.880 --> 18:23.880]  So what does that mean?
[18:23.880 --> 18:27.880]  Your reserved, your quiet, your timid.
[18:27.880 --> 18:29.880]  Your shy.
[18:29.880 --> 18:30.880]  Okay?
[18:30.880 --> 18:34.880]  But if you score high, you are an extroverted individual.
[18:34.880 --> 18:35.880]  Right?
[18:35.880 --> 18:41.880]  You are talkative, you're sociable, you're passionate, you're assertive, you're bold,
[18:41.880 --> 18:42.880]  you're dominant.
[18:42.880 --> 18:45.880]  There's so many different traits that go under here.
[18:45.880 --> 18:46.880]  Yes, son?
[18:46.880 --> 18:49.880]  What would the range be for low and high?
[18:49.880 --> 18:50.880]  Is it like a number range?
[18:51.880 --> 18:55.880]  Yeah, so hold on, because I will bring that up when we take up what we did.
[18:55.880 --> 18:56.880]  Okay?
[18:56.880 --> 19:00.880]  What is your name?
[19:00.880 --> 19:01.880]  Tanveer.
[19:01.880 --> 19:02.880]  Tanveer.
[19:02.880 --> 19:03.880]  That's great.
[19:03.880 --> 19:04.880]  Yes.
[19:04.880 --> 19:06.880]  I'm getting this.
[19:11.880 --> 19:12.880]  Sully.
[19:12.880 --> 19:13.880]  Sully.
[19:13.880 --> 19:15.880]  Raymond Aaron Trenton.
[19:15.880 --> 19:18.880]  Let's start.
[19:18.880 --> 19:19.880]  And A?
[19:19.880 --> 19:22.880]  And A.
[19:22.880 --> 19:25.880]  It's not Aaron, right?
[19:25.880 --> 19:26.880]  Anthony.
[19:26.880 --> 19:27.880]  Anthony.
[19:27.880 --> 19:28.880]  Good, okay.
[19:28.880 --> 19:31.880]  This is how we remember names.
[19:31.880 --> 19:32.880]  Okay, good.
[19:32.880 --> 19:35.880]  Oh my god, I forgot your name.
[19:35.880 --> 19:36.880]  Tanveer, right?
[19:36.880 --> 19:37.880]  Tanveer.
[19:37.880 --> 19:38.880]  Okay, good.
[19:38.880 --> 19:39.880]  All right.
[19:39.880 --> 19:40.880]  Okay.
[19:41.880 --> 19:50.880]  Up to big five, extroversion is the easiest to judge in zero situations, zero acquaintance
[19:50.880 --> 19:51.880]  situations.
[19:51.880 --> 19:53.880]  So what do I mean by that?
[19:53.880 --> 19:57.880]  These are situations in which two people have just met.
[19:57.880 --> 19:58.880]  Okay?
[19:58.880 --> 20:01.880]  So think about it.
[20:02.880 --> 20:10.880]  It only takes you five minutes to figure out if someone is an extrovert or an introvert.
[20:10.880 --> 20:16.880]  Like it only took me five minutes to figure this out.
[20:16.880 --> 20:19.880]  Now you tell me if you fall in that category, okay?
[20:19.880 --> 20:24.880]  It took me five minutes to figure out that Anthony is an introvert.
[20:24.880 --> 20:26.880]  Anthony, am I right?
[20:26.880 --> 20:27.880]  Good.
[20:27.880 --> 20:28.880]  Right?
[20:28.880 --> 20:34.880]  It took me five minutes to figure out that my har-i-ra.
[20:34.880 --> 20:35.880]  Har-kira.
[20:35.880 --> 20:36.880]  Har-kira.
[20:36.880 --> 20:37.880]  Yes.
[20:37.880 --> 20:38.880]  Is an extrovert.
[20:38.880 --> 20:39.880]  I'm like 50-50.
[20:39.880 --> 20:40.880]  50-50, okay.
[20:40.880 --> 20:46.880]  Sure, I'm trying to see if you will be an extrovert.
[20:46.880 --> 20:48.880]  Just put this on an extrovert.
[20:48.880 --> 20:49.880]  Is he really?
[20:49.880 --> 20:50.880]  He is.
[20:50.880 --> 20:51.880]  I already don't know.
[20:51.880 --> 20:52.880]  I don't know myself.
[20:52.880 --> 20:55.880]  Well, we'll figure it out right now.
[20:55.880 --> 20:56.880]  You get two bar girls.
[20:56.880 --> 20:59.880]  One of them has to be an extrovert.
[20:59.880 --> 21:02.880]  Anyway, who is an extrovert?
[21:02.880 --> 21:04.880]  Who did the head?
[21:04.880 --> 21:06.880]  He's not an extrovert.
[21:06.880 --> 21:07.880]  He's not an extrovert.
[21:07.880 --> 21:10.880]  You can tell he's not an extrovert.
[21:10.880 --> 21:13.880]  I think it might be Aaron.
[21:13.880 --> 21:16.880]  I think it might be Aaron.
[21:16.880 --> 21:19.880]  I think it might be Aaron.
[21:20.880 --> 21:23.880]  Down the middle.
[21:23.880 --> 21:26.880]  Down the middle.
[21:26.880 --> 21:27.880]  That's weird.
[21:27.880 --> 21:28.880]  Okay, anyway.
[21:28.880 --> 21:31.880]  Okay, didn't take too long to figure out.
[21:31.880 --> 21:38.880]  Honestly, I feel like you would be in between, but I honestly thought you might be an extrovert.
[21:38.880 --> 21:41.880]  I thought you would be there.
[21:41.880 --> 21:42.880]  I'm like 70-25.
[21:42.880 --> 21:43.880]  Huh?
[21:43.880 --> 21:44.880]  70-25.
[21:44.880 --> 21:45.880]  Oh.
[21:45.880 --> 21:46.880]  So you weren't expecting that.
[21:46.880 --> 21:47.880]  75-25.
[21:47.880 --> 21:48.880]  70%.
[21:48.880 --> 21:49.880]  You were an extrovert?
[21:49.880 --> 21:50.880]  Let's do 80-20.
[21:50.880 --> 21:51.880]  80-20.
[21:51.880 --> 21:52.880]  Yeah, so I was correct.
[21:52.880 --> 21:53.880]  Okay.
[21:53.880 --> 21:54.880]  Right?
[21:54.880 --> 21:55.880]  Yeah.
[21:55.880 --> 21:56.880]  Correct.
[21:56.880 --> 21:57.880]  You were trying to fool me.
[21:57.880 --> 21:58.880]  I was correct.
[21:58.880 --> 21:59.880]  Okay.
[21:59.880 --> 22:00.880]  All right, good.
[22:00.880 --> 22:03.880]  So that's zero acquaintance situation.
[22:03.880 --> 22:08.880]  Interestingly enough, extroversion is related to positive affectivity.
[22:08.880 --> 22:09.880]  What is that?
[22:09.880 --> 22:16.880]  Positive affectivity is basically a dispositional tendency to experience positive.
[22:16.880 --> 22:17.880]  Positive.
[22:17.880 --> 22:18.880]  Engaging moods.
[22:18.880 --> 22:19.880]  Right?
[22:19.880 --> 22:22.880]  So what are some of these positive engaging moods?
[22:22.880 --> 22:30.880]  Well, it might be enthusiasm, it might be excitement, it might be elation, and so forth.
[22:30.880 --> 22:31.880]  Okay?
[22:31.880 --> 22:41.880]  So the tendency to experience positive moods across situations may actually explain why
[22:42.880 --> 22:47.880]  So extroverts tend to be more satisfied with their jobs.
[22:47.880 --> 22:48.880]  Okay?
[22:48.880 --> 22:51.880]  And then as a fun fact, here's another thing.

[22:51.880 --> 22:58.880]  So extroversion is like outside of the workplace, extroverted individuals or extroversion is
[22:58.880 --> 23:01.880]  associated with a number of other positive outcomes.
[23:01.880 --> 23:02.880]  Right?
[23:02.880 --> 23:05.880]  So they might have more partners.
[23:06.880 --> 23:11.880]  Like they probably have gone through a lot of relationships, romantic relationships.
[23:11.880 --> 23:14.880]  So they have more dating partners.
[23:14.880 --> 23:18.880]  They might actually have more friends as well.
[23:18.880 --> 23:19.880]  Right?
[23:19.880 --> 23:23.880]  And they tend parties a lot.
[23:23.880 --> 23:26.880]  Now he's like, no, I'm not 80-20.
[23:26.880 --> 23:28.880]  I'm 50-50.
[23:28.880 --> 23:29.880]  Right?
[23:29.880 --> 23:30.880]  I don't know.
[23:30.880 --> 23:32.880]  It's all debatable.
[23:32.880 --> 23:33.880]  It's all debatable.
[23:33.880 --> 23:34.880]  Sure.
[23:34.880 --> 23:35.880]  Okay.
[23:35.880 --> 23:36.880]  All right.
[23:36.880 --> 23:45.880]  And then finally, extroversion is not necessarily related to performance across all jobs or
[23:45.880 --> 23:46.880]  occupations.
[23:46.880 --> 23:47.880]  Right?
[23:47.880 --> 23:51.880]  It tends to be related to jobs where you need a social interaction.
[23:51.880 --> 23:52.880]  Okay?
[23:52.880 --> 24:00.880]  So an extrovert will do well in places that have that social element.
[24:00.880 --> 24:07.880]  Introverts can still be successful, but they have to train themselves.
[24:07.880 --> 24:08.880]  Okay?
[24:08.880 --> 24:15.880]  So teaching is basically an arena where social interaction is required.
[24:15.880 --> 24:16.880]  Right?
[24:16.880 --> 24:21.880]  Zero acquaintance situation.
[24:21.880 --> 24:24.880]  You tell me, am I an introvert or an extrovert?
[24:24.880 --> 24:25.880]  Introvert.
[24:25.880 --> 24:26.880]  Wow.
[24:27.880 --> 24:30.880]  This is a trick question.
[24:30.880 --> 24:31.880]  Extrovert.
[24:31.880 --> 24:32.880]  Extrovert.
[24:32.880 --> 24:33.880]  Okay.
[24:33.880 --> 24:35.880]  How many of us concur?
[24:35.880 --> 24:39.880]  How many of us think I'm an introvert?
[24:39.880 --> 24:43.880]  I think you're an introvert who learned to be more extroverted.
[24:43.880 --> 24:44.880]  Good.
[24:44.880 --> 24:47.880]  This is what an extroverted person would say.
[24:47.880 --> 24:48.880]  Right?
[24:48.880 --> 24:49.880]  But that's true.
[24:49.880 --> 24:50.880]  You guys are right.
[24:50.880 --> 24:51.880]  So I'm an introvert.
[24:51.880 --> 24:52.880]  Right?
[24:52.880 --> 24:56.880]  But I have to train myself because this is the profession that I chose for myself.
[24:56.880 --> 24:58.880]  It's a social interaction.
[24:58.880 --> 25:01.880]  I needed to train myself to be an extrovert.
[25:01.880 --> 25:02.880]  Okay?
[25:02.880 --> 25:07.880]  So I do, but after class, I don't want to talk to anyone.
[25:07.880 --> 25:09.880]  I just want to be left by myself.
[25:09.880 --> 25:11.880]  I want to curl up, read a book.
[25:11.880 --> 25:13.880]  I just want to be left alone.
[25:13.880 --> 25:17.880]  I've not enjoyed the social relationships that I'm part of.
[25:17.880 --> 25:18.880]  Truth be told.
[25:18.880 --> 25:19.880]  Right?
[25:19.880 --> 25:20.880]  Okay.
[25:20.880 --> 25:25.880]  And I could have chosen a profession that aligned with this particular dimension, but
[25:25.880 --> 25:27.880]  I'm not good with numbers.
[25:27.880 --> 25:29.880]  I hate IT.
[25:29.880 --> 25:30.880]  So I would, right?
[25:30.880 --> 25:32.880]  I would be horrible at it.
[25:32.880 --> 25:35.880]  So it had to be some level of interaction.
[25:35.880 --> 25:37.880]  And that was another joke which no one laughed at.
[25:37.880 --> 25:40.880]  This is why an introvert is never good at jokes.
[25:40.880 --> 25:41.880]  Okay.
[25:41.880 --> 25:48.880]  So going back to the exercise that I just had you complete, these items capture extroversion.
[25:48.880 --> 25:49.880]  Okay?
[25:49.880 --> 25:53.880]  For your test, do you know, do you need to know this?
[25:53.880 --> 25:54.880]  No.
[25:54.880 --> 25:57.880]  For your test, you just need to understand this.
[25:57.880 --> 25:59.880]  What's meant by high and low?
[25:59.880 --> 26:06.880]  So low is introversion, someone who is reserved, quiet, timid, and then know that high is
[26:06.880 --> 26:10.880]  someone who's talkative, social, sociable and whatnot.
[26:10.880 --> 26:11.880]  Okay?
[26:11.880 --> 26:12.880]  All right.
[26:12.880 --> 26:15.880]  Now let's talk about neuroticism.
[26:16.880 --> 26:25.880]  So this particular dimension has, very rarely do we talk about social or emotional stability.
[26:25.880 --> 26:28.880]  We look at it from the lens of neuroticism.
[26:28.880 --> 26:29.880]  Okay?
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.880]  So this has to do with your ability to handle stress.
[26:37.880 --> 26:38.880]  Okay.
[26:38.880 --> 26:42.880]  Someone who scores low on this is neurotic.
[26:42.880 --> 26:43.880]  Okay?
[26:43.880 --> 26:44.880]  What does that mean?
[26:44.880 --> 26:48.880]  Someone who is anxious, insecure, sensitive, angry, depressed.
[26:48.880 --> 26:49.880]  Okay?
[26:49.880 --> 26:53.880]  Someone who scores high, emotionally stable.
[26:53.880 --> 26:58.880]  So you're calm, you're self-confident, you're secure, you're content about yourself, as
[26:58.880 --> 27:01.880]  well as your place in this world.
[27:01.880 --> 27:02.880]  Okay?
[27:02.880 --> 27:05.880]  Emotional stability is related to negative affectivity.
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.880]  So I already told you what positive affectivity was.
[27:09.880 --> 27:13.880]  What do you think negative affectivity refers to?
[27:14.880 --> 27:15.880]  What was positive affectivity?
[27:15.880 --> 27:16.880]  Yes?
[27:16.880 --> 27:19.880]  Like you just have negative interactions throughout your life?
[27:19.880 --> 27:20.880]  No, no, no.
[27:20.880 --> 27:21.880]  It has to do with mood.
[27:21.880 --> 27:23.880]  Oh, like you're just in a negative mood.
[27:23.880 --> 27:24.880]  Yes.
[27:24.880 --> 27:27.880]  You experience more of the negative moods.
[27:27.880 --> 27:28.880]  Yes, what's that?
[27:28.880 --> 27:32.880]  It would also be related to being a mood killer, like in your God-like mind.
[27:32.880 --> 27:33.880]  Yeah, sure.
[27:33.880 --> 27:34.880]  That would be you.
[27:34.880 --> 27:35.880]  Ooh.
[27:35.880 --> 27:36.880]  Ooh.
[27:36.880 --> 27:37.880]  Ooh.
[27:37.880 --> 27:38.880]  Ooh.
[27:38.880 --> 27:43.880]  That's like the only time when I bring people down, do you laugh.
[27:43.880 --> 27:45.880]  That's not nice of you guys, okay?
[27:45.880 --> 27:46.880]  That's a joke.
[27:46.880 --> 27:49.880]  You know you're one of my favorite people.
[27:49.880 --> 27:54.880]  Now they're like, how do I become one of Sam's favorite people?
[27:54.880 --> 27:58.880]  For instance, like I don't hear how you go to finance when I count it.
[27:58.880 --> 27:59.880]  What?
[27:59.880 --> 28:00.880]  I don't go to finance.
[28:00.880 --> 28:01.880]  You don't go to finance?
[28:01.880 --> 28:02.880]  I don't go to finance.
[28:02.880 --> 28:03.880]  Oh, you don't have finance?
[28:03.880 --> 28:04.880]  Good luck.
[28:04.880 --> 28:05.880]  No.
[28:05.880 --> 28:06.880]  What if you do have it?
[28:06.880 --> 28:07.880]  Do you like numbers?
[28:07.880 --> 28:08.880]  Yeah.
[28:08.880 --> 28:09.880]  Okay.
[28:09.880 --> 28:12.880]  You seem like the person who would like numbers.
[28:12.880 --> 28:13.880]  Why?
[28:13.880 --> 28:14.880]  I see that.
[28:14.880 --> 28:15.880]  Right?
[28:15.880 --> 28:16.880]  No, I'm kidding.
[28:16.880 --> 28:17.880]  I'm teasing.
[28:17.880 --> 28:18.880]  I want to make you laugh.
[28:18.880 --> 28:20.880]  I want you to enjoy this, okay?
[28:20.880 --> 28:23.880]  But Mustafa, okay, going back to you.
[28:23.880 --> 28:27.880]  Yes, unpleasant moods, and of course that would have a negative effect on us, right?

[28:27.880 --> 28:29.880]  I hope that's not me.
[28:29.880 --> 28:30.880]  Okay?
[28:30.880 --> 28:31.880]  Good.
[28:31.880 --> 28:32.880]  All right, good.
[28:32.880 --> 28:33.880]  Okay.
[28:33.880 --> 28:36.880]  So, you experience unpleasant moods, right?
[28:36.880 --> 28:38.880]  So, you experience nervousness.
[28:38.880 --> 28:40.880]  You experience annoyance.
[28:40.880 --> 28:42.880]  You experience hostility.
[28:42.880 --> 28:52.880]  So, this is why people who are neurotic are not happy at the workplace.
[28:52.880 --> 28:56.880]  But those who are more stable emotionally are happy at the workplace.
[28:56.880 --> 28:58.880]  They're more satisfied with the job.
[28:58.880 --> 29:00.880]  Does that make sense?
[29:00.880 --> 29:02.880]  Okay, good.
[29:02.880 --> 29:04.880]  All right.
[29:04.880 --> 29:06.880]  Do I really want you to know this?
[29:06.880 --> 29:08.880]  No, let's forget that.
[29:08.880 --> 29:10.880]  I don't think it's going to be on your test either.
[29:10.880 --> 29:12.880]  But I will just talk about this.
[29:12.880 --> 29:17.880]  So, neuroticism actually influences the way that people deal with stressful situations.
[29:17.880 --> 29:18.880]  Okay?
[29:18.880 --> 29:26.880]  Emotional stability is associated with the first, which is differential exposure to stressors.
[29:26.880 --> 29:36.880]  Meaning that neurotic individuals are more likely to appraise day-to-day situations as stressful.
[29:36.880 --> 29:38.880]  Okay?
[29:38.880 --> 29:46.880]  So, basically, they then become exposed to the stressors more frequently because they're viewing it as stressful.
[29:46.880 --> 29:48.880]  Does that make sense?
[29:48.880 --> 29:49.880]  Okay.
[29:49.880 --> 29:53.880]  Emotional stability is more so with differential reactivity.
[29:53.880 --> 29:56.880]  But again, you don't really need to know this.
[29:56.880 --> 30:05.880]  What that means is that neurotic individuals are less likely to believe that they can cope with the stressors that they experience.
[30:06.880 --> 30:07.880]  Okay?
[30:07.880 --> 30:08.880]  I just had a question.
[30:08.880 --> 30:17.880]  Like, what do you say that for neuroticism, like, would people score below the average, like, below 50%?
[30:17.880 --> 30:20.880]  Would they be on the bottom percentile?
[30:20.880 --> 30:24.880]  You guys really want to know how you did on the test, right?
[30:24.880 --> 30:25.880]  So, wait.
[30:25.880 --> 30:26.880]  Wait, I will come to you.
[30:26.880 --> 30:27.880]  I will come.
[30:27.880 --> 30:28.880]  Just wait.
[30:28.880 --> 30:31.880]  Just hold on until you know the definition.
[30:31.880 --> 30:32.880]  Okay?
[30:32.880 --> 30:35.880]  Because there's a reason why I'm not telling you right now.
[30:35.880 --> 30:38.880]  Emotional stability and neuroticism are like polar opposites.
[30:38.880 --> 30:39.880]  Yes.
[30:39.880 --> 30:40.880]  Yeah.
[30:40.880 --> 30:43.880]  So, is this slide referring to the low high referring to emotional stability or the low high referring to neuroticism?
[30:43.880 --> 30:44.880]  No.
[30:44.880 --> 30:51.880]  So, the low is referring to neuroticism and the high is referring to emotional stability.
[30:51.880 --> 30:52.880]  Okay.
[30:52.880 --> 30:53.880]  Okay.
[30:53.880 --> 30:54.880]  Make sense?
[30:54.880 --> 30:55.880]  Yeah.
[30:55.880 --> 30:56.880]  Did you all get that?
[30:56.880 --> 30:57.880]  Okay.
[30:57.880 --> 30:58.880]  Good.
[30:58.880 --> 30:59.880]  Okay.
[30:59.880 --> 31:02.880]  So, why is this the second best predictor of job performance?
[31:02.880 --> 31:06.880]  The first best predictor is conscientiousness, which I'll describe in a few minutes.
[31:06.880 --> 31:10.880]  But why is this the second best predictor of job performance?
[31:10.880 --> 31:11.880]  Why do you think?
[31:11.880 --> 31:17.880]  Because you're going to go through stressful times at your job and it depends on your time.
[31:17.880 --> 31:18.880]  Exactly.
[31:18.880 --> 31:19.880]  Right?
[31:19.880 --> 31:24.880]  Like, it's, you're not going to, you're not going to be able to deal with the stressors.
[31:24.880 --> 31:25.880]  Right?
[31:25.880 --> 31:29.880]  So, we don't really want a lot of robotic individuals in the workforce.
[31:29.880 --> 31:30.880]  Right?
[31:30.880 --> 31:34.880]  So, you kind of have to train yourself to be emotionally calm and stable.
[31:34.880 --> 31:37.880]  All right.
[31:37.880 --> 31:43.880]  Going back to the exercise, these are the terms or these are the adjectives, I would
[31:43.880 --> 31:47.880]  say, that capture emotional stability and neuroticism.
[31:47.880 --> 31:48.880]  Okay?
[31:48.880 --> 31:54.880]  Let's now talk about agreeableness, the complete opposite of this cartoon over here.
[31:54.880 --> 31:59.880]  Agreeableness has to do with your ability to get along with others.
[31:59.880 --> 32:00.880]  Okay?
[32:00.880 --> 32:03.880]  It's your degree of courtesy, trust, cooperation, and tolerance.
[32:03.880 --> 32:05.880]  So, that's you.
[32:05.880 --> 32:08.880]  So, here's the thing.
[32:08.880 --> 32:16.880]  Agreeable people, they prioritize, write this down, they prioritize communion striving.
[32:16.880 --> 32:17.880]  Okay?
[32:17.880 --> 32:20.880]  Communion striving.
[32:20.880 --> 32:22.880]  So, what does that mean?
[32:22.880 --> 32:26.880]  They focus on really getting along with others.
[32:26.880 --> 32:27.880]  Okay?
[32:27.880 --> 32:37.880]  So, people who score low on this particular dimension, they focus on their own needs,
[32:37.880 --> 32:43.880]  they're less likely to be liked by others, they're suspicious, they're inflexible, they're
[32:43.880 --> 32:50.880]  irritable, but those who score high are more forgiving, they're good natured, they're cooperative,
[32:50.880 --> 32:53.880]  they're warm, they're trusted.
[32:53.880 --> 32:54.880]  Okay?
[32:54.880 --> 33:02.880]  If you score low, just based on these adjectives, you can tell that you don't really like to
[33:02.880 --> 33:04.880]  get along with others.
[33:04.880 --> 33:05.880]  Right?
[33:05.880 --> 33:07.880]  People irritate you.
[33:07.880 --> 33:11.880]  If you score high, you can tell that you do want to get along with others, you do want
[33:11.880 --> 33:15.880]  to vent to like him, and so you're going to be more forgiving and good natured and cooperative
[33:15.880 --> 33:17.880]  and all that stuff.
[33:17.880 --> 33:19.880]  Okay?
[33:19.880 --> 33:22.880]  Now, what do we see?
[33:22.880 --> 33:26.880]  Agreeableness is not related to performance across all jobs.
[33:26.880 --> 33:27.880]  Right?
[33:27.880 --> 33:29.880]  Or occupation.
[33:29.880 --> 33:31.880]  Why not?
[33:31.880 --> 33:35.880]  Because remember that term that I gave you in the beginning, the communion striving?
[33:35.880 --> 33:37.880]  Right?
[33:37.880 --> 33:43.880]  Striving for communion is beneficial in some jobs, but not others.
[33:43.880 --> 33:45.880]  Okay?
[33:46.880 --> 33:51.880]  So, to get along with others is beneficial in some, but not others.
[33:51.880 --> 33:53.880]  Okay?
[33:53.880 --> 33:56.880]  What might be some of those jobs?
[33:56.880 --> 33:58.880]  Okay?
[33:58.880 --> 34:00.880]  Think about it.
[34:00.880 --> 34:07.880]  So, you want interaction, you want to help others, you want to cooperate, you want to
[34:07.880 --> 34:09.880]  nurture others, you want to involve teamwork and cooperation.
[34:09.880 --> 34:14.880]  So, what are some jobs that you can think of where getting along with others is beneficial?
[34:14.880 --> 34:16.880]  So, hair.
[34:16.880 --> 34:17.880]  Teaching.
[34:17.880 --> 34:18.880]  Teaching.
[34:18.880 --> 34:19.880]  Good.
[34:19.880 --> 34:20.880]  Aaron.
[34:20.880 --> 34:21.880]  Customer service.
[34:21.880 --> 34:22.880]  Customer service.
[34:22.880 --> 34:23.880]  Salim.
[34:23.880 --> 34:24.880]  Salim.
[34:24.880 --> 34:25.880]  Politics.
[34:25.880 --> 34:26.880]  Politics.
[34:26.880 --> 34:27.880]  Yes, you're right.

[34:42.880 --> 34:43.880]  Really?
[34:43.880 --> 34:52.880]  Where you interact with others and you want them to like you.
[34:52.880 --> 34:53.880]  A bank teller.
[34:53.880 --> 34:54.880]  Bank teller.
[34:54.880 --> 34:55.880]  Sure.
[34:55.880 --> 34:58.880]  Okay, what is your name?
[34:58.880 --> 34:59.880]  Jimmy.
[34:59.880 --> 35:00.880]  Jimmy.
[35:00.880 --> 35:01.880]  Okay, yes.
[35:01.880 --> 35:02.880]  Heart.
[35:02.880 --> 35:03.880]  Hiccup.

[35:05.880 --> 35:06.880]  Hiccup.
[35:06.880 --> 35:07.880]  Hiccup.
[35:07.880 --> 35:08.880]  Hiccup.
[35:08.880 --> 35:09.880]  Hiccup.
[35:09.880 --> 35:10.880]  Hiccup.
[35:10.880 --> 35:11.880]  Hiccup.
[35:11.880 --> 35:12.880]  No, no, with an M at the end.
[35:12.880 --> 35:13.880]  A-I-K-A-M.
[35:13.880 --> 35:14.880]  Hiccup.
[35:14.880 --> 35:15.880]  A-I-K-A-M.
[35:15.880 --> 35:16.880]  Hiccup.
[35:16.880 --> 35:17.880]  Hiccup.
[35:17.880 --> 35:18.880]  Yes, heart.
[35:18.880 --> 35:19.880]  I was going to say sales.
[35:19.880 --> 35:20.880]  Sales, yeah, sales, right?
[35:20.880 --> 35:21.880]  Okay, here are some more.
[35:21.880 --> 35:32.880]  No, just, I'm going to start with, what does it start with?
[35:32.880 --> 35:33.880]  Sam.
[35:33.880 --> 35:34.880]  Sam.
[35:34.880 --> 35:35.880]  Sam.
[35:35.880 --> 35:36.880]  Sam.
[35:36.880 --> 35:37.880]  Sam.
[35:37.880 --> 35:40.880]  I was going to say a music artist.
[35:40.880 --> 35:41.880]  A movie?
[35:41.880 --> 35:42.880]  A music artist.
[35:42.880 --> 35:45.880]  Music artist, yeah, sure, sure.
[35:45.880 --> 35:46.880]  Broker.
[35:46.880 --> 35:47.880]  Broker.
[35:47.880 --> 35:48.880]  Broker.
[35:48.880 --> 35:49.880]  Broker.
[35:49.880 --> 35:50.880]  Broker.
[35:50.880 --> 35:51.880]  Broker.
[35:51.880 --> 35:52.880]  Yes, okay, sure.
[35:52.880 --> 35:53.880]  Healthcare.
[35:53.880 --> 35:54.880]  Healthcare.
[35:54.880 --> 35:58.880]  Yes, healthcare, nurses, doctors, yes, okay.
[35:58.880 --> 36:00.880]  Here are two more participation marks.
[36:00.880 --> 36:01.880]  Yes, go on.
[36:01.880 --> 36:02.880]  Social work.
[36:02.880 --> 36:03.880]  Social work.
[36:03.880 --> 36:04.880]  What's your name again?
[36:04.880 --> 36:05.880]  Desiree.
[36:05.880 --> 36:06.880]  Desiree.
[36:06.880 --> 36:07.880]  And you're a son?
[36:07.880 --> 36:08.880]  Oh, my?
[36:08.880 --> 36:09.880]  Yeah.
[36:09.880 --> 36:10.880]  The shiny.
[36:10.880 --> 36:11.880]  The shiny?
[36:11.880 --> 36:12.880]  Yeah, I was going to say real estate agent.
[36:12.880 --> 36:13.880]  Real estate agent, okay, good.
[36:13.880 --> 36:14.880]  Yes, go ahead.
[36:14.880 --> 36:15.880]  Any management position, like anywhere.
[36:15.880 --> 36:16.880]  Okay, any management position, sure.
[36:16.880 --> 36:17.880]  Last person.
[36:17.880 --> 36:18.880]  Like a rapper.
[36:18.880 --> 36:19.880]  A rapper, sure.
[36:19.880 --> 36:20.880]  Okay, all right.
[36:20.880 --> 36:27.880]  Okay, so what this is telling us is that there are some occupations, some jobs, we're
[36:28.880 --> 36:33.880]  agreeable individuals will thrive, right?
[36:33.880 --> 36:42.880]  When you don't have, so basically these are jobs where the employee has direct face-to-face
[36:42.880 --> 36:51.880]  or verbal contact with the person that they're interacting with, okay?
[36:52.880 --> 37:01.880]  So agreeableness has actually been shown consistently to have or to be associated with strong customer
[37:01.880 --> 37:05.880]  service skills, okay?
[37:05.880 --> 37:12.880]  So a customer service representative, good ones, are going to be agreeable, okay?
[37:12.880 --> 37:13.880]  Make sense?
[37:13.880 --> 37:16.880]  All right, good.
[37:16.880 --> 37:23.880]  So here are the items from that test that I had you do that captures this particular
[37:23.880 --> 37:25.880]  dimension, okay?
[37:25.880 --> 37:29.880]  Now let's talk about conscientiousness, okay?
[37:29.880 --> 37:35.880]  So conscientiousness, this is the big one when it comes to predicting job requirements,
[37:35.880 --> 37:36.880]  okay?
[37:36.880 --> 37:44.880]  Conscientiousness, formally, it is defined as a degree of organization, dependability,
[37:44.880 --> 37:50.880]  thoroughness, and achievement-oriented activities that a person exhibits, okay?
[37:50.880 --> 37:53.880]  So it's a measure of liability as well as dependability.
[37:53.880 --> 37:58.880]  So these individuals, they show up in time, right, or on time.
[37:58.880 --> 38:00.880]  They persevere on their tasks.
[38:00.880 --> 38:02.880]  They check details.
[38:02.880 --> 38:05.880]  They make sure that their work is accurate.
[38:05.880 --> 38:13.880]  They make sure that it is done right the first time around, okay?
[38:13.880 --> 38:19.880]  So it might be fun to be with someone who is less conscientious, right?
[38:19.880 --> 38:20.880]  It might be fun.
[38:20.880 --> 38:22.880]  Yeah, it might be fun.
[38:22.880 --> 38:30.880]  But in a job setting, when you're hiring someone, you want someone who is high on this particular
[38:30.880 --> 38:34.880]  dimension, as you can imagine, okay?
[38:34.880 --> 38:36.880]  Does that make sense?
[38:36.880 --> 38:37.880]  Okay.
[38:37.880 --> 38:42.880]  So someone who scores low, unreliable, unorganized, unpredictable.
[38:42.880 --> 38:50.880]  Someone who scores high, organized, responsible, diligent, dependable, and so forth, okay?
[38:50.880 --> 38:54.880]  It predicts job performance the best, right?
[38:54.880 --> 39:05.880]  So the obvious question is why is it that conscientious individuals perform better, right?
[39:05.880 --> 39:10.880]  Well, I will talk more about this when we talk about motivation, but there was this
[39:10.880 --> 39:13.880]  one study on sales individuals.
[39:13.880 --> 39:20.880]  And what they found was that conscientiousness was positively related to the sales goals
[39:20.880 --> 39:23.880]  that were set by the individual, okay?
[39:23.880 --> 39:28.880]  As well as the salesperson's commitment to those goals.
[39:28.880 --> 39:33.880]  And goal setting is a form of motivation, okay?
[39:33.880 --> 39:36.880]  We'll talk more about that during motivation.
[39:36.880 --> 39:42.880]  So their findings, basically, I just mentioned one study, but their findings suggest to us
[39:42.880 --> 39:52.880]  that conscientiousness actually works through motivational mechanisms to increase performance,
[39:52.880 --> 39:54.880]  okay?
[39:54.880 --> 40:00.880]  So conscientiousness influences performance through motivational mechanisms.
[40:00.880 --> 40:03.880]  So let me bring in research study here.
[40:03.880 --> 40:05.880]  What's the IV?
[40:09.880 --> 40:13.880]  Conscientiousness, performance, motivational mechanism.
[40:13.880 --> 40:15.880]  Which, what's the IV?
[40:22.880 --> 40:23.880]  Yes.
[40:23.880 --> 40:24.880]  Conscientiousness.
[40:24.880 --> 40:25.880]  What's the DB?
[40:25.880 --> 40:26.880]  Not Erin.
[40:26.880 --> 40:28.880]  Erin's already here.
[40:28.880 --> 40:29.880]  Yes.
[40:29.880 --> 40:30.880]  Job performance.
[40:30.880 --> 40:31.880]  Job performance.
[40:31.880 --> 40:40.880]  What is mechanical, motivational, motivation is what?
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.880]  Is it a moderator or a mediator?
[40:44.880 --> 40:45.880]  Red.
[40:45.880 --> 40:46.880]  Moderator.
[40:46.880 --> 40:47.880]  No.
[40:47.880 --> 40:49.880]  It's a mediator, right?

[40:49.880 --> 40:57.880]  Right, remember mediator explains why a relationship exists, right?
[40:57.880 --> 41:05.880]  A moderator explains to us under what conditions does this relationship exist, okay?
[41:05.880 --> 41:06.880]  Good.
[41:06.880 --> 41:13.880]  Okay, so from your tests, these are the items that capture conscientiousness, okay?
[41:13.880 --> 41:16.880]  Let's talk about openness to experience.
[41:16.880 --> 41:18.880]  So this is the final dimension.
[41:18.880 --> 41:25.880]  So this has to do with the capacity to entertain new ideas, to change as a result of making
[41:25.880 --> 41:28.880]  information to be creative or even open-minded.
[41:28.880 --> 41:32.880]  So those who score low are cautious, they're narrow-minded.
[41:32.880 --> 41:39.880]  Those who score high tend to be more curious, imaginative, playful, artistic, okay?
[41:39.880 --> 41:47.880]  So much like agreeableness and extroversion, the traits associated with openness are actually
[41:47.880 --> 41:53.880]  beneficial in some jobs but not others, okay?
[41:53.880 --> 41:59.880]  So it's related to job performance in some occupations but not others.
[41:59.880 --> 42:07.880]  So what jobs do you think would benefit by having someone who scores high on openness
[42:07.880 --> 42:08.880]  to experience?
[42:08.880 --> 42:10.880]  What do you think?
[42:10.880 --> 42:11.880]  Yes, Heather?
[42:11.880 --> 42:14.880]  Maybe they could give like the entrepreneurship.
[42:14.880 --> 42:16.880]  Entrepreneurship, good.
[42:16.880 --> 42:17.880]  Anyone else?
[42:17.880 --> 42:18.880]  Marketing.
[42:18.880 --> 42:19.880]  Marketing, sure.
[42:19.880 --> 42:21.880]  What is your name?
[42:21.880 --> 42:22.880]  Andrew.
[42:22.880 --> 42:23.880]  Andrew.
[42:23.880 --> 42:25.880]  Raymond, did you have something?
[42:25.880 --> 42:26.880]  Marketing, okay.
[42:26.880 --> 42:27.880]  Anyone else?
[42:27.880 --> 42:28.880]  Yes.
[42:28.880 --> 42:29.880]  Artist.
[42:29.880 --> 42:30.880]  Artist, right?
[42:30.880 --> 42:31.880]  Yeah, good.
[42:31.880 --> 42:42.880]  Okay, so you see this, you see an increase in job performance in occupations where or
[42:42.880 --> 42:50.880]  in jobs that are very fluid, right, that are very dynamic.
[42:50.880 --> 42:58.880]  You also see it in occupations where the job demands, there are changes in them and they're
[42:58.880 --> 43:00.880]  rapid in them, okay?
[43:00.880 --> 43:06.880]  You also see it in occupations like you said where you see a lot of speed.
[43:06.880 --> 43:07.880]  Okay.
[43:07.880 --> 43:08.880]  All right.
[43:08.880 --> 43:19.880]  Now one of the other things is that openness is related to training proficiency, okay?
[43:19.880 --> 43:27.880]  So employees who score high on openness to experience, they tend to excel in training
[43:27.880 --> 43:29.880]  and learning environments.
[43:29.880 --> 43:30.880]  Okay?
[43:30.880 --> 43:31.880]  Why?
[43:31.880 --> 43:34.880]  Because their curiosity comes in.
[43:34.880 --> 43:43.880]  Their curiosity gives them this built-in desire and motivation to learn new things, right?
[43:43.880 --> 43:48.880]  And training proficiency, basically what they're referring to is like how successful are you
[43:48.880 --> 43:51.880]  in the training program, okay?
[43:51.880 --> 43:59.880]  And so these are the items that capture the openness to experience dimension, okay?
[43:59.880 --> 44:00.880]  All right.
[44:00.880 --> 44:02.880]  So now let's talk about your results.
[44:02.880 --> 44:05.880]  Okay, so you should have had five full numbers.
[44:05.880 --> 44:10.880]  I don't remember if I told you to average them or if I just told you to sum them up.
[44:10.880 --> 44:12.880]  Which one did I make you do?
[44:12.880 --> 44:13.880]  Sum them up.
[44:13.880 --> 44:14.880]  Sum them up, okay.
[44:14.880 --> 44:19.880]  So each dimension, I believe, I don't remember, let me see how many there were.
[44:19.880 --> 44:20.880]  I think there were eight.
[44:20.880 --> 44:23.880]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[44:23.880 --> 44:24.880]  It was eight.
[44:24.880 --> 44:30.880]  So each dimension, because the scale is out of five and there are eight items for each
[44:30.880 --> 44:33.880]  dimension, it should be out of 40, okay?
[44:33.880 --> 44:40.880]  Anything that is 19 and below is low on that dimension.
[44:40.880 --> 44:43.880]  Anything that is 20 and above is high.
[44:47.880 --> 44:49.880]  Is it reflective of who you are?
[44:57.880 --> 45:00.880]  Did we score high on extroversion?
[45:04.880 --> 45:05.880]  I forgot to do it.
[45:05.880 --> 45:06.880]  You forgot to do it.
[45:06.880 --> 45:09.880]  Oh yeah, I was going to say, I believe you didn't do it.
[45:09.880 --> 45:10.880]  Yeah, okay.
[45:10.880 --> 45:11.880]  How about you just read it?
[45:11.880 --> 45:13.880]  You asked me the question of neuroticism.
[45:13.880 --> 45:15.880]  Yeah, I just have that question.
[45:15.880 --> 45:16.880]  I didn't do it either.
[45:18.880 --> 45:21.880]  Do it so you understand where you fall.
[45:21.880 --> 45:22.880]  Okay, who did it?
[45:22.880 --> 45:23.880]  Oh, great.
[45:23.880 --> 45:25.880]  These are my favorite people now.
[45:25.880 --> 45:26.880]  Okay, great.
[45:26.880 --> 45:27.880]  Okay, so let's talk about it.
[45:27.880 --> 45:29.880]  Let's talk about your scores.
[45:29.880 --> 45:32.880]  Do you think they're reflective of who you are?
[45:33.880 --> 45:34.880]  Somewhat?
[45:35.880 --> 45:37.880]  Is there somebody that threw you off guard?
[45:37.880 --> 45:39.880]  You're like, oh no, I don't think I'm like that.
[45:41.880 --> 45:42.880]  No?
[45:42.880 --> 45:43.880]  Okay.
[45:43.880 --> 45:44.880]  Yes.
[45:44.880 --> 45:46.880]  I quit sedation three years ago, so of course.
[45:46.880 --> 45:47.880]  Okay.
[45:47.880 --> 45:52.880]  And I was surprised that my other friends were not so negative.
[45:52.880 --> 45:53.880]  Oh, did it?
[45:53.880 --> 45:56.880]  Okay, so are you less neurotic now or more neurotic?
[45:56.880 --> 45:57.880]  Less neurotic.
[45:57.880 --> 46:00.880]  So have you gone through any sort of training?
[46:00.880 --> 46:01.880]  No.
[46:01.880 --> 46:02.880]  No?
[46:02.880 --> 46:05.880]  Do you feel less stressed out now than you did three years ago?
[46:05.880 --> 46:08.880]  Three years ago you would have started your program, right?
[46:08.880 --> 46:09.880]  No.
[46:09.880 --> 46:10.880]  No?
[46:10.880 --> 46:11.880]  Oh, sorry.
[46:11.880 --> 46:12.880]  It was the second year.
[46:12.880 --> 46:13.880]  I forgot.
[46:13.880 --> 46:16.880]  I thought it was my third year in general.
[46:16.880 --> 46:18.880]  Yeah, that was around like 12th grade.
[46:18.880 --> 46:20.880]  Oh, so you were finishing up.
[46:20.880 --> 46:23.880]  You were probably stressed about what you did first, right?
[46:23.880 --> 46:28.880]  Okay, so the stressors were more probably at that time than they are now.
[46:28.880 --> 46:30.880]  But did you score the same on the others I mentioned?
[46:32.880 --> 46:33.880]  Or relatively the same?
[46:33.880 --> 46:36.880]  Relatively the same except for extra-reported.
[46:36.880 --> 46:38.880]  Okay, what happened on the extra-reported?
[46:38.880 --> 46:39.880]  It went slightly up.
[46:39.880 --> 46:40.880]  Slightly up, okay.
[46:40.880 --> 46:42.880]  Okay, it's probably pretty high.
[46:42.880 --> 46:43.880]  Okay, it makes sense.
[46:43.880 --> 46:44.880]  But it will stay like that.
[46:44.880 --> 46:53.880]  For the most part, these traits will stay like that until and unless some major event happens, right?
[46:53.880 --> 46:58.880]  Where you need therapy, for example, or you need to change your thing.
[46:58.880 --> 47:02.880]  But for your adulthood, most of these will stay relatively the same.
[47:02.880 --> 47:05.880]  So you said you have to become more extroverted, right?
[47:05.880 --> 47:06.880]  So when did that happen for you?
[47:06.880 --> 47:08.880]  When I joined the profession.

[47:08.880 --> 47:09.880]  And how long was that?
[47:09.880 --> 47:11.880]  26 minutes.
[47:11.880 --> 47:12.880]  Okay.
[47:12.880 --> 47:13.880]  No, actually it was a little bit.
[47:13.880 --> 47:16.880]  Okay, so I was slowly developing myself.
[47:16.880 --> 47:17.880]  What I mean by that is this.
[47:17.880 --> 47:19.880]  I'll tell you a personal story.
[47:19.880 --> 47:28.880]  So my undergrad, I was like just like, so in high school, I was a little outgoing, right?
[47:28.880 --> 47:29.880]  It was a small high school.
[47:29.880 --> 47:32.880]  I went to a private school, so it was like only 11 of us.
[47:32.880 --> 47:33.880]  Okay?
[47:33.880 --> 47:34.880]  Yeah.
[47:34.880 --> 47:36.880]  So your personality comes out.
[47:36.880 --> 47:39.880]  So I played hockey, I played soccer.
[47:39.880 --> 47:41.880]  Like I was like very good, right?
[47:41.880 --> 47:49.880]  Then when we go into a university setting, my default personality was just introversion.
[47:49.880 --> 47:54.880]  So in undergrad, I really just focused on my study.
[47:54.880 --> 47:57.880]  Like I didn't want to just like that.
[47:57.880 --> 48:00.880]  I was like in my books, I was like one of the highest.
[48:00.880 --> 48:03.880]  I actually graduated with this major too.
[48:03.880 --> 48:06.880]  So it was like I was very much into my books.
[48:06.880 --> 48:08.880]  Then I went to masters.
[48:08.880 --> 48:17.880]  Masters, you're in, so very, very many people apply for a master's program, but very few people get in.
[48:17.880 --> 48:19.880]  Especially for master's PhD, right?
[48:19.880 --> 48:25.880]  So my cohort was only I think maybe about 11 students, right?
[48:25.880 --> 48:27.880]  And I remember this.
[48:27.880 --> 48:28.880]  I still remember it.
[48:28.880 --> 48:31.880]  It was my social psychology class.
[48:31.880 --> 48:38.880]  And we, here, if I give you marks for participation, it's only like 10% at the undergraduate level, right?
[48:38.880 --> 48:39.880]  For each course.
[48:39.880 --> 48:42.880]  Like master's, it's almost 50.
[48:42.880 --> 48:45.880]  It's high, right?
[48:45.880 --> 48:46.880]  Like you have to participate.
[48:46.880 --> 48:48.880]  Like there's no tomorrow.
[48:48.880 --> 48:53.880]  And so three classes went by and I wasn't participating, right?
[48:53.880 --> 48:57.880]  But the instructor was my supervisor.
[48:57.880 --> 49:00.880]  So she knew that I was competent.
[49:00.880 --> 49:02.880]  She knew this, right?
[49:02.880 --> 49:06.880]  She knew that Santa knows her stuff, but she's not saying anything.
[49:06.880 --> 49:12.880]  So she asked me, she took me aside and she said, you know, participation matters a lot.
[49:12.880 --> 49:16.880]  You're not participating, but I know you know the material.
[49:16.880 --> 49:17.880]  So what's going on?
[49:17.880 --> 49:21.880]  And I was like, I just don't know how to say it.
[49:21.880 --> 49:27.880]  Because I was allowing the dominant students to just like to answer the questions, right?
[49:27.880 --> 49:31.880]  So I just didn't know how to like put up my hand and say, I have a thing too.
[49:31.880 --> 49:32.880]  I have a thing too, right?
[49:32.880 --> 49:39.880]  I was also very, oh my goodness, is my response going to be looked in a positive way or not, right?
[49:39.880 --> 49:42.880]  So she asked me, how can I make it easier for you?
[49:42.880 --> 49:45.880]  And I said, pick on me.
[49:45.880 --> 49:47.880]  Please just pick on me.
[49:47.880 --> 49:50.880]  Say Santa, do you have anything to contribute?
[49:50.880 --> 49:55.880]  And so that's what I kind of have I'm doing in my teaching now too.
[49:55.880 --> 49:59.880]  I will either pick on you or I will just wait until everyone has participated.
[49:59.880 --> 50:02.880]  Once you feel better about it, right?
[50:02.880 --> 50:06.880]  So that's when I started to show some changes.
[50:06.880 --> 50:11.880]  So talking more and more and more and more in class, that's when this happened.
[50:11.880 --> 50:20.880]  But when I finished my PhD and I was taught to teach social psychology at York University during my postdoc,
[50:20.880 --> 50:22.880]  it was much bigger than this.
[50:22.880 --> 50:25.880]  It was 200 and I think 20 students, OK?
[50:25.880 --> 50:27.880]  Big lecture hall.
[50:27.880 --> 50:34.880]  And I can you just imagine if I was like, hi, social psychology is a psychology of human beings, right?
[50:34.880 --> 50:37.880]  Like in social, people will not take me seriously.
[50:37.880 --> 50:43.880]  So there's this one that I will talk about it in communication when we talk about that chapter.
[50:43.880 --> 50:46.880]  I'm hoping I get the time to show you that video.
[50:46.880 --> 50:51.880]  There's this one video that I was introduced to in my PhD.
[50:51.880 --> 50:55.880]  And it's all about power postures, right?
[50:55.880 --> 51:05.880]  So it talks a little bit about how like, you know, powerful postures are like you just like what MBA students do, right?
[51:05.880 --> 51:09.880]  Like they're just like, yeah, like this, like open your body.
[51:09.880 --> 51:19.880]  And that brings in a number of different positive outcomes, like your confidence level, your testosterone goes up and your cortisol goes down and all that stuff.
[51:19.880 --> 51:21.880]  Right. So I did that.
[51:21.880 --> 51:29.880]  I remember right before my class, I went into the bathroom and I did the powerful posture.
[51:29.880 --> 51:33.880]  And I continued doing that for my social psych class.
[51:33.880 --> 51:36.880]  And and then that's how I trained myself.
[51:36.880 --> 51:38.880]  So I've been doing it.
[51:38.880 --> 51:41.880]  Now I don't. Now I just now I'm like very confidently.
[51:41.880 --> 51:43.880]  I'm like, OK, I'm just going to say whatever.
[51:43.880 --> 51:49.880]  Right. I reached that point now, but it took a lot of training for me to get to that point.
[51:49.880 --> 51:51.880]  Why? You want to change something?
[51:51.880 --> 51:56.880]  No, no, I was just curious because yeah, because I thought that you were extroverted just like from nature.
[51:56.880 --> 51:58.880]  But then when you like, oh, I was introverted before.
[51:58.880 --> 52:00.880]  I was always quiet.
[52:00.880 --> 52:03.880]  The reserved one, the shy, the timid one.
[52:03.880 --> 52:07.880]  I'm thankful to the people who helped me in that journey.
[52:07.880 --> 52:11.880]  But it took many years of training to get to that point.
[52:11.880 --> 52:15.880]  Right. And so today I give off this expression.
[52:15.880 --> 52:18.880]  But honestly, I like being on my own.
[52:18.880 --> 52:22.880]  Right. So yeah, anyway, good question.
[52:22.880 --> 52:24.880]  OK. So what happens?
[52:24.880 --> 52:30.880]  So what I gave you was just one of the scales.
[52:30.880 --> 52:33.880]  The actual scale is much longer.
[52:33.880 --> 52:35.880]  The big five is way longer.
[52:35.880 --> 52:37.880]  I gave you the reduced version.
[52:37.880 --> 52:43.880]  And I also just used an arbitrary halfway midpoint to do high and low.
[52:43.880 --> 52:45.880]  But how does it actually work?
[52:45.880 --> 52:49.880]  When you complete this, this is something that you will see.
[52:49.880 --> 52:52.880]  OK. So you will see this.
[52:52.880 --> 52:55.880]  So I'm showing like, this is not my result.
[52:55.880 --> 52:56.880]  This is not my result.
[52:56.880 --> 52:58.880]  You can just find it from the internet.
[52:58.880 --> 53:05.880]  So it kind of like displays to you where you score on that particular dimension.
[53:05.880 --> 53:11.880]  OK. But one of the things I have noticed, and research indicates this as well,
[53:11.880 --> 53:14.880]  is that during your adulthood, I have already mentioned this,
[53:14.880 --> 53:19.880]  during your adulthood, your personality tends to be the same.
[53:19.880 --> 53:20.880]  Right.
[53:20.880 --> 53:23.880]  So it develops in your childhood.
[53:23.880 --> 53:27.880]  And then during your adulthood, you remain the same.

[53:27.880 --> 53:30.880]  So if you are scoring higher in conscientiousness today,
[53:30.880 --> 53:33.880]  most likely you're going to be scoring higher in conscientiousness
[53:33.880 --> 53:38.880]  until the end of your, I don't know if it's an academic career,
[53:38.880 --> 53:40.880]  but no, it will be until the end of your career.
[53:40.880 --> 53:42.880]  Until the end of your career.
[53:42.880 --> 53:46.880]  OK. And the same thing goes for all the other factors.
[53:46.880 --> 53:51.880]  However, one of the things they say, and I still want to do some research on it,
[53:51.880 --> 53:57.880]  is like when you become even older, you vote your default personality.
[53:57.880 --> 54:01.880]  That is something I want to understand a little bit more.
[54:01.880 --> 54:03.880]  Because I want to understand my dad.
[54:03.880 --> 54:04.880]  Really, I do.
[54:04.880 --> 54:07.880]  He's so cynical, and I'm just like, it's going to get worse.
[54:07.880 --> 54:08.880]  That's what everyone says, right?
[54:08.880 --> 54:10.880]  Like he's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[54:10.880 --> 54:14.880]  And I'm like, what's my dad's default personality like growing up?
[54:14.880 --> 54:16.880]  Like I really want to know what it is.
[54:16.880 --> 54:19.880]  Anyway, so maybe I'll go back to integration.
[54:19.880 --> 54:21.880]  I'm in my 80s and 90s.
[54:21.880 --> 54:22.880]  Yes?
[54:22.880 --> 54:25.880]  Don't you think this way of thinking is kind of like a self-fulfilled prophecy,
[54:25.880 --> 54:26.880]  and it can trap you?
[54:26.880 --> 54:28.880]  Oh, OK. What do you mean by that?
[54:28.880 --> 54:29.880]  How would it trap you?
[54:29.880 --> 54:35.880]  Because you're saying that your personality doesn't change throughout your adulthood.
[54:35.880 --> 54:38.880]  Because you think this, let's say you're an integrated person,
[54:38.880 --> 54:42.880]  because you think you're not going to change, you're actually not changing.
[54:42.880 --> 54:44.880]  No, no, no.
[54:44.880 --> 54:46.880]  I don't think it would become like that.
[54:46.880 --> 54:48.880]  I think you know where you're coming from.
[54:48.880 --> 54:52.880]  But then you would score very low on openness to experience, for example.
[54:52.880 --> 54:53.880]  Right?
[54:53.880 --> 54:54.880]  That's kind of the thing.
[54:54.880 --> 54:57.880]  If you're scoring high, you're more likely...
[54:57.880 --> 54:59.880]  It's not going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[54:59.880 --> 55:03.880]  It's just these are the personality traits that describe you right now.
[55:03.880 --> 55:05.880]  They're most likely going to stick with you.
[55:05.880 --> 55:10.880]  Yes, experiences, training, all that stuff will change it.
[55:10.880 --> 55:14.880]  But your default, your dominant personality will remain the same.
[55:14.880 --> 55:15.880]  Does that help?
[55:15.880 --> 55:16.880]  Yeah.
[55:16.880 --> 55:18.880]  Do you feel better about this test?
[55:18.880 --> 55:20.880]  I mean, I didn't do the test, but I'm just...
[55:20.880 --> 55:21.880]  Oh my god.
[55:21.880 --> 55:23.880]  What was she talking about?
[55:23.880 --> 55:27.880]  I didn't do the test, but it just seems like it's a little trapped.
[55:27.880 --> 55:28.880]  No, it's not. It's not.
[55:28.880 --> 55:30.880]  I understand where you're coming from, but it's not.
[55:30.880 --> 55:33.880]  There's a lot of research to back this up.
[55:33.880 --> 55:36.880]  There's a lot of research, first of all, to back up the dimension.
[55:36.880 --> 55:41.880]  There's a lot of research to indicate that it tends to be relatively stable over time.
[55:41.880 --> 55:45.880]  But I understand where you're coming from.
[55:45.880 --> 55:48.880]  I understand why you would feel that way.
[55:48.880 --> 55:52.880]  And this is another thing.
[55:52.880 --> 56:01.880]  So if you look at the items that I gave you, the actual scale has way more than 40 items or whatever it is.
[56:01.880 --> 56:02.880]  It has more.
[56:03.880 --> 56:07.880]  And you're assessing the dimension in various different ways.
[56:07.880 --> 56:16.880]  So they'll be asking you two or three questions that are assessing the same thing, but in a different way.
[56:16.880 --> 56:23.880]  So that way, you can take off all these self-fulfilling prophecies or any alternative explanation.
[56:23.880 --> 56:24.880]  Because they've asked you this.
[56:24.880 --> 56:28.880]  You'll understand this more when you take research methods, if you ever do.
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.880]  But that's one of the ways in which you can take away all the alternative explanation.
[56:37.880 --> 56:39.880]  And so this is how you usually see it.
[56:39.880 --> 56:44.880]  Even if you just type in big five in Google, this is what will come up.
[56:47.880 --> 56:49.880]  I think I've already mentioned all of this.
[56:49.880 --> 56:51.880]  So I don't really need to mention this.
[56:51.880 --> 56:54.880]  This is just a summary of things.
[56:54.880 --> 56:56.880]  So don't really need to.
[56:56.880 --> 56:57.880]  Don't really need to.
[56:57.880 --> 56:58.880]  Just understand this.
[56:58.880 --> 57:04.880]  Conscientiousness, important for almost all the jobs, is the strongest predictor of job performance.
[57:04.880 --> 57:08.880]  What was the second strongest predictor of job performance?
[57:08.880 --> 57:09.880]  Do we remember?
[57:11.880 --> 57:12.880]  Yes.
[57:12.880 --> 57:13.880]  Neuroarticism.
[57:13.880 --> 57:14.880]  Neuroarticism, okay.
[57:14.880 --> 57:16.880]  Extraversion, neuroticism.
[57:16.880 --> 57:19.880]  This is good for those that have social interaction.
[57:19.880 --> 57:27.880]  Openness experience, more so with jobs with learning creativity, agreeableness, more so with cooperative interactions.
[57:27.880 --> 57:38.880]  And then there's more research, so much research to basically say that it's related to a number of different outcomes that OBE specialists are interested in.
[57:38.880 --> 57:41.880]  And yeah, so there you go.
[57:41.880 --> 57:51.880]  Okay, one of the things I want to talk about is the Myers-Bergs type indicator, MBTI.
[57:51.880 --> 57:53.880]  Have we heard of that?
[57:53.880 --> 57:54.880]  Yeah.
[57:54.880 --> 57:56.880]  Have we gone through it?
[57:56.880 --> 57:57.880]  Yes.
[57:57.880 --> 57:58.880]  Yes?
[57:58.880 --> 57:59.880]  Yeah, okay.
[57:59.880 --> 58:02.880]  So let me talk a little bit about this, okay?
[58:02.880 --> 58:05.880]  And then let me tell you, let me trash talk this.
[58:05.880 --> 58:06.880]  Okay?
[58:07.880 --> 58:13.880]  So MBTI, this is what it does, okay?
[58:13.880 --> 58:24.880]  It basically classifies you on four dimensions to determine one of 16 possible personality types.
[58:24.880 --> 58:25.880]  Okay?
[58:25.880 --> 58:27.880]  So what are these four axes?
[58:27.880 --> 58:29.880]  So it's written over there.
[58:29.880 --> 58:35.880]  Sociable and agreeableness versus quiet and shy, practical and orderly, unconsciousness.
[58:35.880 --> 58:38.880]  So that's basically how you would read that, okay?
[58:38.880 --> 58:47.880]  So there's 16 possible personality types according to this particular personality test, okay?
[58:47.880 --> 58:50.880]  INTJ is one of them, okay?
[58:50.880 --> 58:56.880]  INTJ, I think I believe, are said to be revision, they're supposed to be what they're called.
[58:56.880 --> 58:59.880]  They have like original minds.
[58:59.880 --> 59:02.880]  They have great drive for their own ideas and purposes.
[59:02.880 --> 59:04.880]  I forget the exact terminology.
[59:04.880 --> 59:07.880]  I think it's like visionary or something like that.
[59:07.880 --> 59:09.880]  I could be wrong, okay?
[59:09.880 --> 59:11.880]  But that's that.
[59:11.880 --> 59:14.880]  There's another thing called ESTJ.
[59:14.880 --> 59:21.880]  Those are known as organizers, so they're more realistic, logical, analytical, and so forth.
[59:21.880 --> 59:25.880]  Okay, so sure, MBTI is there.
