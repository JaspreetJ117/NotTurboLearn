[00:00.000 --> 00:18.760]  I had a situation in my very first class this morning,
[00:18.760 --> 00:24.440]  and it's never happened in my academic career so far.
[00:24.440 --> 00:31.440]  And being student-oriented has its advantages.
[00:31.440 --> 00:37.040]  For you guys, obviously, and I also feel good when I see all those times and stuff.
[00:37.040 --> 00:42.640]  But I realize that people get to take advantage of that, too.
[00:42.640 --> 00:50.840]  And then that, then I have to raise my voice, and I don't like doing that.
[00:51.440 --> 00:56.440]  So I'm not knowing that I'm doing my voice, and that is affecting me greatly.
[00:58.440 --> 01:02.440]  Yeah, to the point where right now I'm talking about it and I want to cry.
[01:02.440 --> 01:05.040]  I'm going to crawl up in my corner and cry.
[01:05.040 --> 01:06.440]  Seriously, I do cry.
[01:06.440 --> 01:07.840]  I don't feel good.
[01:07.840 --> 01:14.440]  I don't feel good that I have to scold a student, and then now I'm off talking badly about me,
[01:14.440 --> 01:16.440]  and the other students are coming to me saying,
[01:17.040 --> 01:22.040]  It's not your fault that students have been disrupted in other classes for two years,
[01:22.040 --> 01:24.040]  so don't pay attention to it.
[01:24.040 --> 01:26.040]  But I'm just like, I feel bad.
[01:26.040 --> 01:29.040]  And then you don't want to know this.
[01:29.040 --> 01:31.040]  Girls call me therapist.
[01:31.040 --> 01:33.040]  So, right?
[01:33.040 --> 01:36.040]  Anyway, so what I'm going to do is,
[01:36.040 --> 01:38.040]  so I apologize if I'm not as upbeat,
[01:38.040 --> 01:42.040]  but maybe just being with you might make me feel a little bit better.
[01:42.040 --> 01:44.040]  So let's do this.
[01:44.040 --> 01:47.040]  So I am one chapter full behind,
[01:47.040 --> 01:52.040]  and the reason why is because the very first day of class I spent so long on introduction,
[01:52.040 --> 01:54.040]  which I sure have done.
[01:54.040 --> 01:56.040]  But we should have a class on introductions.
[01:56.040 --> 02:01.040]  I think that is what I'm going to advocate if I ever teach this course again.
[02:01.040 --> 02:06.040]  But having said that, I was going to record this for you,
[02:06.040 --> 02:12.040]  and then I realized this is imported testable material and I cannot record it for you.
[02:12.040 --> 02:14.040]  Because of that, like why?
[02:14.040 --> 02:16.040]  It's because it's better if I explain it to you.
[02:16.040 --> 02:18.040]  So this is what I'm going to do.
[02:18.040 --> 02:20.040]  I'm going to go through this lecture,
[02:20.040 --> 02:24.040]  and I'm going to try and explain these tough concepts to you.
[02:24.040 --> 02:26.040]  The chapter for today,
[02:26.040 --> 02:29.040]  I will try and record that,
[02:29.040 --> 02:34.040]  because a lot of that is just like, you will understand it if you listen to me,
[02:34.040 --> 02:36.040]  or if you read my slides.
[02:36.040 --> 02:41.040]  But then there is one component of that chapter that is testable,
[02:41.040 --> 02:43.040]  and that is the short answer.
[02:43.040 --> 02:48.040]  So that I will bring back to class next class and talk about it.
[02:48.040 --> 02:50.040]  Does that help?
[02:50.040 --> 02:52.040]  So today after class, when I get home,
[02:52.040 --> 02:56.040]  I will de-stress and then I will record.
[02:56.040 --> 02:59.040]  Hopefully I'll be able to do it in class,
[02:59.040 --> 03:05.040]  but if not, I will record that little component for this class.
[03:05.040 --> 03:07.040]  Anyway, let's get right into it.
[03:07.040 --> 03:13.040]  So remember last week, I kind of tried to talk about learning,
[03:13.040 --> 03:15.040]  but I was not very successful at it.
[03:15.040 --> 03:21.040]  So again, learning, awkward learning theory, social cognitive theory,
[03:21.040 --> 03:24.040]  these are the things I want you to be know about.
[03:24.040 --> 03:28.040]  So let me quickly go through this slide once more.
[03:28.040 --> 03:30.040]  So learning, like it says on your slide,
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.040]  it's a relatively permanent change in behavior potential,
[03:35.040 --> 03:37.040]  which I'll talk about in a few minutes,
[03:37.040 --> 03:42.040]  that results from practice or experience.
[03:42.040 --> 03:48.040]  So the key takeaway here really is that learning does not always lead
[03:48.040 --> 03:51.040]  to an immediate change in behavior,
[03:51.040 --> 03:58.040]  but it changes the potential to behave differently in the future.
[03:59.040 --> 04:06.040]  So the other point that's on this slide is that learning is driven by feedback.
[04:06.040 --> 04:11.040]  It is shaped by the consequences of our actions.
[04:11.040 --> 04:16.040]  And this idea, this comes from behavioral theories,
[04:16.040 --> 04:19.040]  or theories I would say, like the operate conditioning,
[04:19.040 --> 04:24.040]  which I'll talk about over the next few slides.
[04:24.040 --> 04:30.040]  But this feedback, it basically shapes future behaviors
[04:30.040 --> 04:35.040]  by either reinforcing or discouraging the actions.
[04:37.040 --> 04:44.040]  So feedback shapes future behaviors by reinforcing or discouraging the actions.
[04:44.040 --> 04:47.040]  So now, before I get into all of that,
[04:47.040 --> 04:51.040]  I want to talk about what is meant by behavioral potential.
[04:51.040 --> 04:57.040]  So a person might not show that immediate behavior immediately.
[04:57.040 --> 05:03.040]  What changes is that person's capacity or their readiness
[05:03.040 --> 05:07.040]  to behave differently when the opportunity arises.
[05:07.040 --> 05:10.040]  So there's a potential to see the change,
[05:10.040 --> 05:13.040]  even though you might not see it immediately.
[05:13.040 --> 05:18.040]  So the example that I gave in last class was swimming.
[05:18.040 --> 05:21.040]  So you can't really demonstrate swimming,
[05:21.040 --> 05:25.040]  I mean in my case it would only be during warmer weathers, right?
[05:25.040 --> 05:30.040]  So you might not be able to demonstrate it until next summer,
[05:30.040 --> 05:33.040]  but the potential to swim is still there.
[05:33.040 --> 05:35.040]  Does that make sense?
[05:35.040 --> 05:39.040]  So that's what's meant by behavioral potential.
[05:39.040 --> 05:42.040]  The change might not be immediately visible,
[05:42.040 --> 05:45.040]  but it will be seen at some point.
[05:45.040 --> 05:49.040]  The potential to change can be seen in the future.
[05:52.040 --> 05:55.040]  Now let's talk about the operant learning theory.
[05:55.040 --> 06:01.040]  So this theory basically states that people learn to operate on the environment
[06:01.040 --> 06:04.040]  to produce certain outcomes.
[06:04.040 --> 06:11.040]  So what that means is that the learner discovers how their action
[06:11.040 --> 06:14.040]  can lead to specific consequences.
[06:14.040 --> 06:19.040]  Either it could lead to reward or it could lead to punishment.
[06:19.040 --> 06:28.040]  So operant learning really focuses on what happens after a behavior is performed.
[06:28.040 --> 06:36.040]  So if the behavior is followed by say a positive outcome,
[06:37.040 --> 06:45.040]  like it's a reward or it's a praise, then that person is likely to repeat it.
[06:45.040 --> 06:54.040]  If it's followed by a negative outcome like criticism or pain,
[06:54.040 --> 06:57.040]  that person is less likely to do it.
[06:57.040 --> 07:04.040]  So it depends on whether that behavior is followed by a positive outcome or a negative outcome.
[07:05.040 --> 07:10.040]  Positive outcome increases your chance of repeating that behavior in the future.
[07:10.040 --> 07:16.040]  Negative outcome, it decreases your chance of repeating that behavior in the future.
[07:19.040 --> 07:24.040]  Now the last thing that I want to mention is this law of affairs.
[07:24.040 --> 07:27.040]  So the definition is provided on this slide.
[07:27.040 --> 07:34.040]  So it's basically that people tend to repeat behaviors that bring them satisfaction and pleasure.
[07:34.040 --> 07:41.040]  And they avoid behaviors that bring them dissatisfaction or pain.
[07:41.040 --> 07:49.040]  And this principle is actually foundational to operant conditioning.
[07:50.040 --> 07:57.040]  So say the behavior is a person or a student like yourself studies hard.
[08:00.040 --> 08:07.040]  Studies hard, receives praise, receives good praise, then what will happen?
[08:07.040 --> 08:12.040]  Is that person going to be more likely to study hard or less likely to study hard?
[08:16.040 --> 08:18.040]  More likely, right?
[08:18.040 --> 08:25.040]  Because the behavior which is studying increases because of the positive consequence.
[08:25.040 --> 08:32.040]  The positive consequence in this case was the reward or the good grades.
[08:32.040 --> 08:33.040]  Make sense?
[08:35.040 --> 08:46.040]  So like I said before, operant conditioning is used to increase the probability of desired behaviors
[08:46.040 --> 08:53.040]  and to reduce or to eliminate the probability of undesirable behaviors.
[08:53.040 --> 08:59.040]  So you want to see desirable behaviors, you do not want to see undesirable behaviors.
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.040]  So let's say I say a joke in class.
[09:03.040 --> 09:10.040]  So the behavior, which is also known as the operant in this case, is telling a joke.
[09:10.040 --> 09:16.040]  So the consequence is that the class laughs.
[09:16.040 --> 09:19.040]  Is that a positive outcome or a negative outcome?
[09:19.040 --> 09:20.040]  Positive.
[09:20.040 --> 09:21.040]  Positive, right?
[09:21.040 --> 09:24.040]  Okay, so what is going to be the result?
[09:24.040 --> 09:26.040]  What will happen after that?
[09:26.040 --> 09:27.040]  You say another joke?
[09:27.040 --> 09:28.040]  Who said that?
[09:28.040 --> 09:29.040]  Oh, okay.
[09:29.040 --> 09:31.040]  Is it there or is it there?
[09:31.040 --> 09:32.040]  Zohair.
[09:32.040 --> 09:33.040]  Zohair, okay.
[09:33.040 --> 09:35.040]  We'll get to that at some point.
[09:35.040 --> 09:36.040]  Okay, yes.
[09:36.040 --> 09:39.040]  I will say another joke in the future.
[09:39.040 --> 09:40.040]  Okay?
[09:40.040 --> 09:42.040]  There you go.
[09:42.040 --> 09:43.040]  Okay.
[09:43.040 --> 09:47.040]  Now say, again, the behavior remains the same.
[09:47.040 --> 09:54.040]  The operant is I tell a joke, but the class groans or has no reaction, right?
[09:54.040 --> 09:57.040]  So what is a negative positive outcome?
[09:57.040 --> 09:58.040]  What is that?
[09:58.040 --> 09:59.040]  Negative.
[09:59.040 --> 10:00.040]  Negative.
[10:00.040 --> 10:02.040]  So what's going to be the result?
[10:02.040 --> 10:03.040]  Tell us jokes.
[10:03.040 --> 10:06.040]  I won't tell a joke in the future, right?
[10:06.040 --> 10:08.040]  So that's basically what it is.
[10:08.040 --> 10:09.040]  Okay?
[10:09.040 --> 10:18.040]  You are trying to increase the desired behavior, reduce or eliminate the undesirable behavior.
[10:18.040 --> 10:20.040]  Does that make sense?
[10:20.040 --> 10:21.040]  Okay.
[10:21.040 --> 10:22.040]  Good.
[10:22.040 --> 10:23.040]  All right.
[10:23.040 --> 10:25.040]  Now, definitely note this.
[10:25.040 --> 10:31.040]  So if you don't understand my note, what I will say, you go into the textbook and you
[10:31.040 --> 10:32.040]  read this up, okay?
[10:32.040 --> 10:33.040]  Hint, hint.
[10:33.040 --> 10:34.040]  I couldn't say that in the recording.
[10:34.040 --> 10:35.040]  That's why I'm doing this.
[10:35.040 --> 10:36.040]  Okay.
[10:37.040 --> 10:46.040]  So operant conditioning can be used to increase the probability of what?
[10:46.040 --> 10:47.040]  Tell me again.
[10:47.040 --> 10:48.040]  What was it?
[10:48.040 --> 10:49.040]  What are we increasing the probability?
[10:49.040 --> 10:50.040]  A desire.
[10:50.040 --> 10:51.040]  Desired behavior.
[10:51.040 --> 10:52.040]  And we're trying to reduce and eliminate the probability of?
[10:52.040 --> 10:53.040]  A undesirable behavior.
[10:53.040 --> 10:54.040]  A undesirable behavior.
[10:54.040 --> 10:55.040]  Good.
[10:55.040 --> 10:56.040]  So there are two ways in which you can increase the probability of behavior.
[10:56.040 --> 10:57.040]  Okay.
[10:57.040 --> 10:58.040]  So let's say you're trying to reduce the probability of a desired behavior.
[10:59.040 --> 11:00.040]  Good.
[11:00.040 --> 11:05.040]  So there are two ways in which you can increase the probability of behavior.
[11:05.040 --> 11:07.040]  Okay.
[11:07.040 --> 11:13.040]  Both based on the concept of reinforcement.
[11:13.040 --> 11:17.040]  Okay.
[11:17.040 --> 11:19.040]  So what are they?
[11:19.040 --> 11:20.040]  You'll see them in green.
[11:20.040 --> 11:22.040]  Where is the line in the first one?
[11:22.040 --> 11:23.040]  So you'll see them in green.
[11:23.040 --> 11:24.040]  Okay.
[11:24.040 --> 11:26.040]  Positive and negative reinforcement.
[11:26.040 --> 11:28.040]  So what's positive reinforcement?
[11:28.040 --> 11:29.040]  Okay.
[11:29.040 --> 11:36.040]  So positive reinforcement, like it says on your slide, is to increase or maintain the
[11:36.040 --> 11:48.040]  probability of some behavior by the application for the addition of a stimulus to the situation
[11:48.040 --> 11:49.040]  in question.
[11:49.040 --> 11:50.040]  Okay.
[11:51.040 --> 12:00.040]  So basically, you are increasing, maintaining the behavior by adding or presenting a pleasant
[12:00.040 --> 12:02.040]  stimulus to the situation.
[12:02.040 --> 12:03.040]  Okay.
[12:03.040 --> 12:07.040]  So you're adding something pleasant after the behavior.
[12:07.040 --> 12:11.040]  So let me give you an example.
[12:11.040 --> 12:18.040]  So giving praise for a reward when someone does something well.
[12:18.040 --> 12:19.040]  What happens?
[12:19.040 --> 12:21.040]  The behavior increases.
[12:21.040 --> 12:22.040]  Right?
[12:22.040 --> 12:25.040]  That is positive reinforcement.
[12:25.040 --> 12:29.040]  You have made an addition to a pleasant stimulus.
[12:29.040 --> 12:30.040]  Right?
[12:30.040 --> 12:32.040]  What is the stimulus in this case?
[12:32.040 --> 12:36.040]  Well, it would probably be the praise for the reward.
[12:36.040 --> 12:37.040]  Okay.
[12:37.040 --> 12:39.040]  So the behavior increases.
[12:39.040 --> 12:40.040]  Make sense?
[12:40.040 --> 12:41.040]  Okay.
[12:42.040 --> 12:49.040]  Now, negative reinforcement is basically, again, like it, see how it says on this table,
[12:49.040 --> 13:01.040]  is to increase or maintain the probability, probability of behavior by removal or where
[13:01.040 --> 13:07.040]  you're taking away of a stimulus from the situation in question.
[13:07.040 --> 13:08.040]  Okay.
[13:08.040 --> 13:19.040]  So basically, you're removing something unpleasant from the situation when the desired behavior
[13:19.040 --> 13:20.040]  occurs.
[13:20.040 --> 13:23.040]  So let me give you an example.
[13:23.040 --> 13:28.040]  So you wear sunglasses, right, because why?
[13:28.040 --> 13:30.040]  Why do we wear sunglasses?
[13:30.040 --> 13:35.040]  Yeah, to stop the glare, right?
[13:35.040 --> 13:36.040]  That's negative.
[13:36.040 --> 13:39.040]  The glare is negative, right?
[13:39.040 --> 13:42.040]  The glare hurts your eyes.
[13:42.040 --> 13:43.040]  Okay.
[13:43.040 --> 13:45.040]  So what will happen then?
[13:45.040 --> 13:48.040]  You will continue wearing the sunglasses.
[13:48.040 --> 13:49.040]  Right?
[13:49.040 --> 13:52.040]  Similarly, you're taking the painkiller.
[13:52.040 --> 13:53.040]  Right?
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.040]  Why are you taking a painkiller?
[13:56.040 --> 13:59.040]  Because it's relieving your headache.
[13:59.040 --> 14:02.040]  It's giving you some sort of relief to your headache.
[14:02.040 --> 14:03.040]  Right?
[14:03.040 --> 14:08.040]  So you're more likely to take the painkiller the next time you have pain.
[14:08.040 --> 14:09.040]  Okay?
[14:09.040 --> 14:12.040]  So do you see the distinction between the two?
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.040]  In positive reinforcement, it's a pleasant stimulus.
[14:16.040 --> 14:17.040]  Right?
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.040]  So it's either a praise, a reward, or something like that.
[14:21.040 --> 14:27.040]  In negative reinforcement, it is, you're still increasing the probability of behavior, but
[14:27.040 --> 14:31.040]  you're basically removing or taking away something negative.
[14:31.040 --> 14:36.040]  So in the cases that I presented to you, the glare that hurts your eyes or your headache
[14:36.040 --> 14:38.040]  is negative.
[14:38.040 --> 14:40.040]  Does that make sense?
[14:40.040 --> 14:42.040]  Okay.
[14:42.040 --> 14:43.040]  Yes or no?
[14:43.040 --> 14:44.040]  Yes.
[14:44.040 --> 14:45.040]  Okay.
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.040]  Now, there are two ways to decrease the probability of behavior.
[14:49.040 --> 14:50.040]  Right?
[14:50.040 --> 14:54.040]  And these are known as extinction in red and punishment.
[14:54.040 --> 14:56.040]  Okay?
[14:56.040 --> 15:00.040]  So what happens when something becomes extinct?
[15:00.040 --> 15:01.040]  Alright.
[15:01.040 --> 15:07.040]  So basically what you're doing is you're removing the reinforcement that has been keeping the
[15:07.040 --> 15:09.040]  behavior going.
[15:09.040 --> 15:11.040]  Okay?
[15:11.040 --> 15:19.040]  Without that reinforcement, basically what happens is that the behavior gradually fades
[15:19.040 --> 15:21.040]  over time.
[15:21.040 --> 15:23.040]  Okay?
[15:23.040 --> 15:26.040]  So, here's an example.
[15:26.040 --> 15:28.040]  A child throwing a tantrum.
[15:28.040 --> 15:29.040]  Okay?
[15:29.040 --> 15:35.040]  So a child throws tantrums to obviously get attention.
[15:35.040 --> 15:44.040]  But if the parent stops responding, right, so no longer gives attention to that child,
[15:44.040 --> 15:50.040]  the tantrums will eventually stop because they are no longer reinforced.
[15:50.040 --> 15:53.040]  They're no longer paid attention to.
[15:53.040 --> 15:55.040]  That's basically what extinction refers to.
[15:55.040 --> 16:02.040]  Extinction is basically trying to say that without that reinforcement, behavior will
[16:02.040 --> 16:03.040]  become extinct.
[16:03.040 --> 16:06.040]  It will basically just fade over time.
[16:06.040 --> 16:09.040]  The child will just stop throwing a tantrum.
[16:09.040 --> 16:11.040]  Does that make sense?
[16:11.040 --> 16:12.040]  Yes.
[16:12.040 --> 16:18.040]  One of the other examples would be like, let's say like when you make money, you're basically
[16:18.040 --> 16:20.040]  adding a pleasant stimulus.
[16:20.040 --> 16:27.040]  And then when you use the money to pay off your debt, you're removing negative stimulus
[16:27.040 --> 16:32.040]  or unpleasant stimulus in a way.
[16:32.040 --> 16:36.040]  Which one would it be or what would be both?
[16:36.040 --> 16:39.040]  If you are making money.
[16:39.040 --> 16:44.040]  So let's say you get a check of like 10 grand every month, right?
[16:44.040 --> 16:45.040]  Right.
[16:45.040 --> 16:46.040]  And that increases your bank balance.
[16:46.040 --> 16:52.040]  That's going to be a pleasant stimulus because you're adding, sorry, that's going to be
[16:52.040 --> 16:54.040]  positive reinforcement, right?
[16:54.040 --> 16:56.040]  Because you're adding pleasant stimulus.
[16:56.040 --> 17:04.040]  Positive reinforcement is just you doing things that will lead to an increase in your desired behavior.
[17:04.040 --> 17:05.040]  Right?
[17:05.040 --> 17:08.040]  That's basically what a positive reinforcement is.
[17:08.040 --> 17:13.040]  Negative reinforcement is you're like taking away something, you're taking away a negative
[17:13.040 --> 17:18.040]  stimulus, but it would still lead to the desired behavior.
[17:18.040 --> 17:20.040]  If that makes any sense.
[17:20.040 --> 17:22.040]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[17:22.040 --> 17:23.040]  Alright.
[17:23.040 --> 17:24.040]  Okay.
[17:24.040 --> 17:29.040]  So extinction, we all understand, like the easiest way for me to make you understand that
[17:29.040 --> 17:35.040]  is just that when you remove that reinforcement, the behavior becomes extinct.
[17:35.040 --> 17:39.040]  Basically it is no longer, or it's going to fade over time.
[17:39.040 --> 17:40.040]  Okay?
[17:40.040 --> 17:49.040]  Then punishment is involving an unpleasant, is adding an unpleasant consequence after
[17:49.040 --> 17:54.040]  an unwanted behavior to make it less likely to happen again.
[17:54.040 --> 17:55.040]  Okay?
[17:55.040 --> 18:06.040]  So punishment again involves adding an unpleasant consequence after an unwanted behavior to
[18:06.040 --> 18:08.040]  make it less likely to happen again.
[18:08.040 --> 18:09.040]  Okay?
[18:09.040 --> 18:13.040]  So for example, a student talks out of turn.
[18:13.040 --> 18:15.040]  Alright?
[18:15.040 --> 18:21.040]  The teacher gives a detention.
[18:21.040 --> 18:26.040]  The student is less likely to talk out of turn in the future.
[18:31.040 --> 18:34.040]  That's sort of what I did this morning.
[18:35.040 --> 18:38.040]  But we shall see if it works next time.
[18:38.040 --> 18:39.040]  Alright?
[18:39.040 --> 18:40.040]  Does that make sense?
[18:40.040 --> 18:41.040]  Yes.
[18:41.040 --> 18:42.040]  Okay.
[18:42.040 --> 18:43.040]  So definitely, yes, Anne?
[18:43.040 --> 18:48.040]  On the term, should we use the words that you say or the words that are written on the
[18:48.040 --> 18:49.040]  slideshow?
[18:49.040 --> 18:51.040]  The words that are written on the slideshow.
[18:51.040 --> 18:54.040]  I mean, I just presented, I just talked a little bit about them.
[18:54.040 --> 18:55.040]  Yeah.
[18:55.040 --> 18:56.040]  Right?
[18:56.040 --> 18:57.040]  I just explained them to you.
[18:57.040 --> 18:58.040]  But you should know this.
[18:58.040 --> 18:59.040]  Okay?
[18:59.040 --> 19:00.040]  Know this.
[19:00.040 --> 19:04.040]  Know that there are two ways in which you can increase the probability of behavior.
[19:04.040 --> 19:06.040]  Two ways to reinforce behavior.
[19:06.040 --> 19:10.040]  So even if you didn't take notes of what I was saying, go to your textbook, take down
[19:10.040 --> 19:13.040]  the definition of positive and negative reinforcement.
[19:13.040 --> 19:14.040]  Just the definitions.
[19:14.040 --> 19:15.040]  Right?
[19:15.040 --> 19:19.040]  And then know that there are two ways to decrease the probability of behaviors.
[19:19.040 --> 19:23.040]  So to prevent behaviors, which is extinction and punishment.
[19:23.040 --> 19:26.040]  Again, if you weren't taking notes of what I was saying, that's okay.
[19:26.040 --> 19:29.040]  Or if I jumbled it up and you didn't understand it, that's okay.
[19:29.040 --> 19:32.040]  Go to the textbook, just get the definitions.
[19:32.040 --> 19:33.040]  Okay?
[19:33.040 --> 19:34.040]  Alright.
[19:34.040 --> 19:35.040]  Okay.
[19:35.040 --> 19:38.040]  So let's talk a little bit more about this.
[19:38.040 --> 19:43.040]  So I actually did go ahead and provide you with the definitions.
[19:43.040 --> 19:48.040]  But anyway, so there are two ways to increase the probability of behavior.
[19:48.040 --> 19:53.040]  Again, both based on the concept of reinforcement.
[19:53.040 --> 19:55.040]  So what is reinforcement?
[19:55.040 --> 19:56.040]  Let me just put it all up there.
[19:56.040 --> 19:57.040]  Okay?
[19:57.040 --> 20:06.040]  So reinforcement is basically the process by which stimuli strengthens behavior.
[20:06.040 --> 20:07.040]  Okay?
[20:07.040 --> 20:11.040]  So write that down, because that's not on your slide.
[20:11.040 --> 20:18.040]  Reinforcement is a process by which stimuli strengthens behaviors.
[20:18.040 --> 20:19.040]  Okay?
[20:20.040 --> 20:27.040]  A reinforcer is, like it says on your slide, a stimulus that follows some behaviors,
[20:27.040 --> 20:33.040]  and it increases or maintains the probability of that behavior.
[20:33.040 --> 20:41.040]  Positive reinforcers, they work by their application to the stim situation, right?
[20:41.040 --> 20:45.040]  So you are adding a pleasant stimulus.
[20:45.040 --> 20:49.040]  So what's negative reinforcement or reinforcers?
[20:49.040 --> 20:54.040]  They work by their removal from that situation.
[20:54.040 --> 20:55.040]  Okay?
[20:58.040 --> 21:00.040]  So these are the definitions.
[21:00.040 --> 21:01.040]  Okay.
[21:01.040 --> 21:03.040]  Now let me give you an example.
[21:03.040 --> 21:05.040]  So positive reinforcement.
[21:05.040 --> 21:06.040]  Okay?
[21:06.040 --> 21:09.040]  So positive reinforcement, remember what it does.
[21:09.040 --> 21:17.040]  It increases or it maintains the probability of some behavior by the application, right?
[21:17.040 --> 21:23.040]  Or addition of the stimulus to the situation in question.
[21:23.040 --> 21:26.040]  So the stimulus is called a positive reinforcement.
[21:26.040 --> 21:27.040]  Okay.
[21:27.040 --> 21:32.040]  So basically you are adding something pleasant after a behavior,
[21:32.040 --> 21:36.040]  which makes the behavior likely to happen again.
[21:36.040 --> 21:37.040]  Okay?
[21:37.040 --> 21:42.040]  So say you participate in class, right?
[21:42.040 --> 21:51.040]  So participating behavior might be that you answer a question when asked.
[21:51.040 --> 21:52.040]  Okay?
[21:52.040 --> 21:56.040]  What could be some possible consequences?
[21:56.040 --> 22:00.040]  Well, if it's me, it's going to be some sort of praise, right?
[22:00.040 --> 22:02.040]  We already established that.
[22:02.040 --> 22:04.040]  So I praise you.
[22:04.040 --> 22:05.040]  Okay?
[22:05.040 --> 22:06.040]  So what will that do?
[22:06.040 --> 22:11.040]  It will actually increase the participating behavior.
[22:11.040 --> 22:13.040]  Right?
[22:13.040 --> 22:18.040]  So the student is more likely to participate again, which is my hope.
[22:18.040 --> 22:21.040]  Make sense?
[22:21.040 --> 22:22.040]  Okay.
[22:22.040 --> 22:24.040]  Negative reinforcement.
[22:24.040 --> 22:25.040]  Okay?
[22:25.040 --> 22:26.040]  So remember what that was.
[22:26.040 --> 22:35.040]  It was increase or maintain the probability of some behavior by removal of a stimulus from the situation.
[22:35.040 --> 22:36.040]  Okay?
[22:36.040 --> 22:44.040]  So it also occurs when a response prevents some event or stimulus from occurring.
[22:44.040 --> 22:45.040]  Okay?
[22:45.040 --> 22:52.040]  And that removed or prevented stimulus is called a negative reinforcement.
[22:52.040 --> 22:53.040]  Okay?
[22:53.040 --> 22:56.040]  So basically what that means is in a nutshell,
[22:56.040 --> 23:00.040]  you are removing something unpleasant from the behavior.
[23:00.040 --> 23:01.040]  Okay?
[23:01.040 --> 23:06.040]  Which increases the likelihood of that behavior.
[23:06.040 --> 23:09.040]  So for example, I wrote my dissertation.
[23:09.040 --> 23:10.040]  Right?
[23:10.040 --> 23:13.040]  I worked on it.
[23:13.040 --> 23:16.040]  The consequence was why?
[23:16.040 --> 23:20.040]  Well, I wanted my supervisor to stop nagging me about it.
[23:20.040 --> 23:21.040]  Okay?
[23:21.040 --> 23:25.040]  I wanted her to stop nagging me about the progress.
[23:25.040 --> 23:28.040]  That was the unpleasantness of the behavior.
[23:28.040 --> 23:31.040]  I wanted her to stop nagging me about the progress.
[23:31.040 --> 23:34.040]  That was the unpleasant stimulus right there.
[23:34.040 --> 23:36.040]  Something negative is unpleasant.
[23:36.040 --> 23:37.040]  Right?
[23:37.040 --> 23:39.040]  Her nagging me is unpleasant.
[23:39.040 --> 23:41.040]  So what did that do?
[23:41.040 --> 23:47.040]  Well, I was more likely to keep on writing my dissertation.
[23:47.040 --> 23:50.040]  Is this now making more sense?
[23:50.040 --> 23:51.040]  Positive and negative.
[23:51.040 --> 23:52.040]  Yes?
[23:52.040 --> 23:56.040]  So positive, both are increasing the probability of behavior.
[23:56.040 --> 23:57.040]  Right?
[23:57.040 --> 23:59.040]  The word increase is right there.
[23:59.040 --> 24:02.040]  So both are increasing the probability of behavior.
[24:02.040 --> 24:09.040]  But in a positive reinforcement, you're basically getting some pleasant stimulus
[24:09.040 --> 24:14.040]  after the behavior to kind of reinforce the behavior.
[24:14.040 --> 24:15.040]  Okay?
[24:15.040 --> 24:22.040]  So an elementary student getting a star for attendance.
[24:22.040 --> 24:23.040]  It's a pleasant thing.
[24:23.040 --> 24:24.040]  Getting the star is pleasant.
[24:24.040 --> 24:25.040]  Right?
[24:25.040 --> 24:27.040]  So that reinforces the behavior.
[24:27.040 --> 24:31.040]  Oh, my God, I'm going to a day of next class, too.
[24:31.040 --> 24:33.040]  That's my elementary student's rotation.
[24:33.040 --> 24:34.040]  Right?
[24:34.040 --> 24:36.040]  That's positive.
[24:36.040 --> 24:43.040]  Negative reinforcement is basically you're removing the unpleasant situation.
[24:43.040 --> 24:44.040]  Right?
[24:44.040 --> 24:45.040]  Or the stimulus.
[24:45.040 --> 24:46.040]  Unpleasant.
[24:46.040 --> 24:48.040]  The glare is unpleasant.
[24:48.040 --> 24:51.040]  The heading is unpleasant.
[24:51.040 --> 24:52.040]  Right?
[24:52.040 --> 24:57.040]  The supervisor nagging is unpleasant.
[24:57.040 --> 24:59.040]  So it's going to increase the behavior.
[24:59.040 --> 25:00.040]  What's the behavior?
[25:00.040 --> 25:03.040]  In the glare, wearing the sunglasses.
[25:03.040 --> 25:04.040]  Right?
[25:04.040 --> 25:07.040]  Headings, it would be the painkillers.
[25:07.040 --> 25:12.040]  Dissertation, sorry, nagging of the supervisor would increase the likelihood
[25:12.040 --> 25:14.040]  that I would continue writing my dissertation.
[25:14.040 --> 25:16.040]  Make sense?
[25:16.040 --> 25:17.040]  Yes?
[25:17.040 --> 25:19.040]  Is it making more sense?
[25:19.040 --> 25:20.040]  Yeah?
[25:20.040 --> 25:22.040]  Okay, good.
[25:22.040 --> 25:26.040]  So reinforcement is a very powerful tool.
[25:26.040 --> 25:27.040]  Okay?
[25:27.040 --> 25:32.040]  But it only works effectively when it's used correctly.
[25:32.040 --> 25:36.040]  But there are some common mistakes that can happen.
[25:36.040 --> 25:37.040]  Okay?
[25:37.040 --> 25:40.040]  So the first is, and definitely know this, hint, hint.
[25:40.040 --> 25:42.040]  Definitely know this, okay?
[25:42.040 --> 25:46.040]  So what is one mistake that can happen?
[25:46.040 --> 25:49.040]  Well, you can confuse rewards with reinforcements.
[25:49.040 --> 25:54.040]  So not all rewards are reinforcements.
[25:54.040 --> 26:02.040]  A reward only works as a reinforcement if it actually increases the desired behavior.
[26:02.040 --> 26:04.040]  Okay?
[26:04.040 --> 26:12.040]  So giving everyone a sticker after class, regardless of participation, for example,
[26:12.040 --> 26:14.040]  might actually feel nice.
[26:14.040 --> 26:17.040]  Like all those kids, they get a sticker.
[26:17.040 --> 26:20.040]  Some have participated, some have not.
[26:20.040 --> 26:22.040]  Right?
[26:22.040 --> 26:28.040]  It feels nice, but it doesn't actually reinforce participation if it's not tied to something.
[26:28.040 --> 26:29.040]  Right?
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.040]  If it's not tied to the specific behavior, which is participation.
[26:33.040 --> 26:36.040]  Does that make sense?
[26:36.040 --> 26:42.040]  If I give everyone 10 out of 10, then you're wondering, why should I even participate?
[26:42.040 --> 26:44.040]  She's going to give 10 out of 10 anyway.
[26:44.040 --> 26:47.040]  So that's what I mean by that.
[26:47.040 --> 26:52.040]  Reinforcement only works if it's tied to specific behavior.
[26:52.040 --> 26:53.040]  Yes?
[26:53.040 --> 26:56.040]  In that example, what if the stickers are different?
[26:56.040 --> 26:59.040]  One's encouragement, while the other's like, good job.
[26:59.040 --> 27:01.040]  One's more like, oh, participate next time.
[27:01.040 --> 27:03.040]  While the other one's saying, good job.
[27:03.040 --> 27:04.040]  Yeah, that's fine, too.
[27:04.040 --> 27:06.040]  That does tend to happen in elementary school, right?
[27:06.040 --> 27:07.040]  Then it won't.
[27:07.040 --> 27:13.040]  Then reinforcement does have a meaning associated to it.
[27:13.040 --> 27:15.040]  So it doesn't apply in that case.
[27:15.040 --> 27:16.040]  Right?
[27:16.040 --> 27:19.040]  I think you're talking about the red sticker, green sticker, yellow sticker.
[27:19.040 --> 27:20.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[27:20.040 --> 27:23.040]  So then it has a different meaning associated to it.
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.040]  So you're still reinforcing good behavior because the green sticker ones are getting the best.
[27:27.040 --> 27:28.040]  Right?
[27:28.040 --> 27:29.040]  There's still a meaning attached to it.
[27:29.040 --> 27:34.040]  But when there's no meaning, then it doesn't have enough implementation.
[27:34.040 --> 27:35.040]  Okay?
[27:35.040 --> 27:36.040]  That's the first.
[27:37.040 --> 27:43.040]  The second really has to do with ignoring individual differences.
[27:43.040 --> 27:44.040]  Okay?
[27:44.040 --> 27:52.040]  For what reinforces one person might not motivate another.
[27:52.040 --> 27:53.040]  Okay?
[27:53.040 --> 28:01.040]  So effective reinforcement must be personally meaningful.
[28:01.040 --> 28:02.040]  Okay?
[28:02.040 --> 28:09.040]  For example, if I praise someone in a public domain, like if I publicly praise someone,
[28:09.040 --> 28:11.040]  for some that's great.
[28:11.040 --> 28:14.040]  Others might be too embarrassed by it.
[28:14.040 --> 28:15.040]  Okay?
[28:15.040 --> 28:17.040]  So yeah, there are situations like that.
[28:17.040 --> 28:19.040]  People might be too embarrassed by it.
[28:19.040 --> 28:26.040]  So you need to ensure that this reinforcement is personally meaningful to that person.
[28:26.040 --> 28:28.040]  Okay?
[28:28.040 --> 28:35.040]  The third really has to do with neglecting important sources or forms of reinforcement.
[28:35.040 --> 28:37.040]  Okay?
[28:37.040 --> 28:44.040]  And there are two powerful but often overlooked forms, which are performance feedback and social recognition.
[28:44.040 --> 28:46.040]  Okay.
[28:46.040 --> 28:48.040]  So performance feedback.
[28:48.040 --> 28:55.040]  People are motivated when they know that they're doing, or when they know how they're doing.
[28:55.040 --> 28:57.040]  Okay?
[28:57.040 --> 29:03.040]  So clear, specific feedback.
[29:03.040 --> 29:11.040]  It allows individuals to understand what behaviors are valued, what should be repeated.
[29:11.040 --> 29:12.040]  Okay?
[29:12.040 --> 29:16.040]  So what I mean by that is sometimes you might see feedback that's quite vague.
[29:16.040 --> 29:17.040]  Right?
[29:17.040 --> 29:19.040]  So just like, good job.
[29:19.040 --> 29:21.040]  That's it.
[29:21.040 --> 29:27.040]  But sometimes you might actually see like three or four sentences talking about your performance.
[29:27.040 --> 29:28.040]  Right?
[29:28.040 --> 29:35.040]  Like, oh, your analysis was actually very well structured and insightful,
[29:35.040 --> 29:39.040]  but then here are some areas in which you can improve.
[29:39.040 --> 29:40.040]  Right?
[29:40.040 --> 29:46.040]  The latter is more likely to bring in that desire behavior.
[29:46.040 --> 29:48.040]  It's more likely to motivate you.
[29:48.040 --> 29:49.040]  Right?
[29:49.040 --> 29:50.040]  Okay.
[29:50.040 --> 29:59.040]  Without feedback, I should also say that even the motivated individuals may feel lost or disconnected.
[29:59.040 --> 30:01.040]  Okay?
[30:01.040 --> 30:04.040]  And the second one is social recognition.
[30:04.040 --> 30:11.040]  So simple acts like praise, like verbal acknowledgement, like public appreciation,
[30:11.040 --> 30:14.040]  these can all be strong reinforcers.
[30:14.040 --> 30:15.040]  Okay?
[30:15.040 --> 30:22.040]  So for example, saying things like, you know, thank you for contributing or great teamwork today.
[30:22.040 --> 30:24.040]  Right?
[30:24.040 --> 30:29.040]  These can actually boost participation and it could boost morale.
[30:29.040 --> 30:31.040]  Right?
[30:31.040 --> 30:36.040]  And especially important in group settings like classrooms or workplaces,
[30:37.040 --> 30:48.040]  we, recognition can reinforce both the behavior as well as the thing known as a sense of belonging,
[30:48.040 --> 30:54.040]  where you're feeling valued, where you're feeling respected, where you're feeling like a member of that organization.
[30:54.040 --> 30:56.040]  Okay?
[30:56.040 --> 30:58.040]  Does that make sense?
[30:58.040 --> 31:00.040]  Okay.
[31:00.040 --> 31:02.040]  All right.
[31:02.040 --> 31:04.040]  So we're going to go into this.
[31:05.040 --> 31:16.040]  So when you're using reinforcement, how and when you deliver, it matters just as much as what the reinforcement is.
[31:16.040 --> 31:18.040]  Okay?
[31:18.040 --> 31:21.040]  So there are two things that you should know.
[31:21.040 --> 31:25.040]  There's the fast acquisition and then there's persistence.
[31:25.040 --> 31:26.040]  Okay?
[31:26.040 --> 31:32.040]  So for fast acquisition, all you really need to know is this,
[31:32.040 --> 31:45.040]  that you're using continuous and that you're using immediate or like short, immediate or short delay reinforcement.
[31:45.040 --> 31:47.040]  Okay?
[31:50.040 --> 31:53.040]  So here's an example.
[31:53.040 --> 31:59.040]  So I give my dog a treat.
[31:59.040 --> 32:00.040]  Right?
[32:00.040 --> 32:05.040]  Every time he performs the correct behavior and I give it immediately.
[32:05.040 --> 32:08.040]  That's fast acquisition right there.
[32:08.040 --> 32:09.040]  Right?
[32:09.040 --> 32:18.040]  Continuous, I'm giving my dog a treat every time he performs the act, the behavior.
[32:18.040 --> 32:21.040]  Okay?
[32:21.040 --> 32:23.040]  And I do it so immediately.
[32:23.040 --> 32:25.040]  So see the blue arrows?
[32:25.040 --> 32:27.040]  That leads to fast acquisition.
[32:27.040 --> 32:28.040]  Okay?
[32:28.040 --> 32:32.040]  Where the frequency of the reinforcement is continuous.
[32:32.040 --> 32:34.040]  So you're doing it on a continuous basis.
[32:34.040 --> 32:37.040]  You're doing it every time.
[32:37.040 --> 32:40.040]  And then the reinforcement is short.
[32:40.040 --> 32:43.040]  There's a short delay, meaning it's immediately done.
[32:43.040 --> 32:46.040]  Okay?
[32:46.040 --> 32:51.040]  And then persistence is the other one.
[32:51.040 --> 32:54.040]  Persistence, the frequency is partial.
[32:54.040 --> 32:59.040]  So you're using partial or you're using delayed reinforcement.
[32:59.040 --> 33:00.040]  Okay?
[33:00.040 --> 33:01.040]  So here's the thing.
[33:01.040 --> 33:02.040]  This is what I mean.
[33:02.040 --> 33:06.040]  Let's go back to the example of the dog getting the treat.
[33:06.040 --> 33:07.040]  Right?
[33:07.040 --> 33:23.040]  So if I give my dog a treat, say, every third time he performs the correct behavior, that is partial.
[33:23.040 --> 33:24.040]  Right?
[33:24.040 --> 33:27.040]  It's not done so on a continuous basis.
[33:27.040 --> 33:31.040]  It's not done every time it's seen.
[33:31.040 --> 33:32.040]  Right?
[33:32.040 --> 33:34.040]  It's partial.
[33:34.040 --> 33:47.040]  And then if I delay it for a bit, so I don't give it immediately, I give it like 10 minutes later, that is a delayed reinforcement.
[33:47.040 --> 33:48.040]  Or if I give it late.
[33:48.040 --> 33:49.040]  Does that make sense?
[33:49.040 --> 33:50.040]  Am I making sense there?
[33:50.040 --> 33:51.040]  Okay.
[33:51.040 --> 33:52.040]  So, yes?
[33:52.040 --> 34:01.040]  Wait, so the last situation you were describing, was it the same like, you basically say that it's still continuous when you're giving the dog a treat, it's just a longer delay?
[34:01.040 --> 34:02.040]  It's a longer delay.
[34:02.040 --> 34:06.040]  So I'm giving it like every third time they perform it.
[34:06.040 --> 34:12.040]  But treatment, because it's not there, it's not done so every time.
[34:12.040 --> 34:15.040]  If there is no continuous, I'm giving it treatment.
[34:15.040 --> 34:16.040]  I'm giving it treat.
[34:16.040 --> 34:19.040]  But it's every third time he performs that act.
[34:19.040 --> 34:21.040]  Does that make sense?
[34:21.040 --> 34:22.040]  Right?
[34:22.040 --> 34:25.040]  And I delay the giving of the treatment.
[34:25.040 --> 34:27.040]  That's what I mean.
[34:27.040 --> 34:36.040]  So it's not like, let's say he does a trick and then you give it to him like an hour later, but every time he does a trick you give it an hour later, is that still like?
[34:36.040 --> 34:38.040]  Yeah, so, no, repeat that again.
[34:38.040 --> 34:47.040]  Let's say like every time he does a trick you just give him a treat an hour later because you forgot about it or you needed to do something, but every time he does a trick you still do it like an hour after he does a trick.
[34:47.040 --> 34:49.040]  Okay, so this is the thing.
[34:49.040 --> 34:58.040]  So every time he does something and I delay it, that is still continuous, but it's long.
[34:58.040 --> 35:00.040]  Does that make sense?
[35:00.040 --> 35:01.040]  Right?
[35:01.040 --> 35:11.040]  But if I give it to him every third time or every fourth time he does it, so meaning there are three times where he didn't get the treat.
[35:11.040 --> 35:12.040]  Right?
[35:12.040 --> 35:15.040]  The treatment, the treat is not the same in every case.
[35:15.040 --> 35:16.040]  Does that make sense?
[35:16.040 --> 35:18.040]  And I delayed it.
[35:18.040 --> 35:22.040]  I delayed the one time that I was supposed to give the treat, I delayed it.
[35:22.040 --> 35:25.040]  That is what is meant by partial and long.
[35:25.040 --> 35:26.040]  Okay?
[35:26.040 --> 35:31.040]  So continuous is every time the correct behavior is seen, I've given it.
[35:31.040 --> 35:32.040]  Right?
[35:32.040 --> 35:36.040]  Every single time, whether it's the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, doesn't matter.
[35:36.040 --> 35:37.040]  That's continuous.
[35:37.040 --> 35:40.040]  Partial is every third or fourth time.
[35:40.040 --> 35:42.040]  So meaning the first and second, no treat.
[35:42.040 --> 35:44.040]  Third time, treat.
[35:44.040 --> 35:45.040]  Fourth time, treat.
[35:45.040 --> 35:46.040]  Do you understand what I mean?
[35:46.040 --> 35:48.040]  That's what's meant by partial.
[35:48.040 --> 35:49.040]  Yes?
[35:49.040 --> 35:58.040]  If you give him a treat, like say every hour, and you always give it to him like every hour, would that be considered as continuous and long?
[35:58.040 --> 35:59.040]  Yes.
[35:59.040 --> 36:00.040]  Yes.
[36:00.040 --> 36:01.040]  Yeah.
[36:01.040 --> 36:03.040]  But there is no, don't look at those combinations.
[36:03.040 --> 36:04.040]  Right?
[36:04.040 --> 36:08.040]  This one, just look at the fast acquisition and persistence.
[36:08.040 --> 36:09.040]  Okay?
[36:09.040 --> 36:10.040]  Alright.
[36:10.040 --> 36:12.040]  So, yes?
[36:12.040 --> 36:16.040]  In what situation would you use persistence over fast acquisition?
[36:16.040 --> 36:22.040]  Because like the dog, if you only get the treat sometimes, how does he even know that he's getting it?
[36:22.040 --> 36:25.040]  That's, okay, good question.
[36:25.040 --> 36:32.040]  Fast acquisition is better, right, than persistence, but that is not going to be on your test.
[36:32.040 --> 36:34.040]  Don't complicate it.
[36:34.040 --> 36:35.040]  Don't complicate it.
[36:35.040 --> 36:36.040]  Delete.
[36:36.040 --> 36:37.040]  Don't complicate it.
[36:37.040 --> 36:39.040]  Don't stop challenging me today, too.
[36:39.040 --> 36:41.040]  So, I'm going to be focusing on the dog treat.
[36:41.040 --> 36:44.040]  Everyone now wants to know when should I be feeding my dog?
[36:44.040 --> 36:45.040]  Right?
[36:45.040 --> 36:49.040]  You should be feeding your dog every time.
[36:49.040 --> 36:54.040]  Give your dog the treat immediately after the correct action.
[36:54.040 --> 36:55.040]  Okay?
[36:55.040 --> 36:57.040]  I'm quoting, quote me on that.
[36:57.040 --> 36:58.040]  Alright?
[36:58.040 --> 36:59.040]  Okay.
[36:59.040 --> 37:00.040]  Alright.
[37:00.040 --> 37:06.040]  So, it's best to tailor your reinforcement strategies to the news of the situation.
[37:06.040 --> 37:13.040]  So, no single strategy ever works in every particular context.
[37:13.040 --> 37:16.040]  You have to take into account a number of different things, right?
[37:16.040 --> 37:21.040]  You have to consider if we take it away from the dogs and bring it back to the learners,
[37:21.040 --> 37:25.040]  like us, we have to take a number of different things into consideration.
[37:25.040 --> 37:31.040]  We need to take our age, our preferences, the complexity of the behavior into consideration.
[37:31.040 --> 37:41.040]  So, what I'm trying to say is although it talks about this, it's best to adjust your approach, okay, over time.
[37:41.040 --> 37:49.040]  So, maybe you start off with continuous reinforcement, then you move on to intermediate, then you build persistence,
[37:49.040 --> 37:52.040]  but again, tailor it to the situation.
[37:52.040 --> 37:56.040]  And that is too complex for you and you will not be tested on it.
[37:56.040 --> 37:58.040]  So, do not worry about that.
[37:58.040 --> 37:59.040]  Okay?
[37:59.040 --> 38:00.040]  Alright.
[38:00.040 --> 38:06.040]  There are basically now, so I've now talked about reinforcements, right?
[38:06.040 --> 38:08.040]  I've talked about positive and negative.
[38:08.040 --> 38:14.040]  So, I talked about the two green stuff in that particular grid, okay?
[38:14.040 --> 38:21.040]  Now, let's talk about how to reduce the probability of the learning behavior, right?
[38:21.040 --> 38:24.040]  And remember, there were two strategies for that.
[38:24.040 --> 38:27.040]  There was punishment and then extinction, okay?
[38:27.040 --> 38:35.040]  So, punishment involves the application of an aversive or an unpleasant stimulus, right?
[38:35.040 --> 38:40.040]  Following undesirable behavior to decrease its occurrence.
[38:46.040 --> 38:47.040]  Alright?
[38:47.040 --> 38:58.040]  So, you basically added some negative stimulus to some negative behavior so that it doesn't occur in the future.
[38:58.040 --> 39:00.040]  Basically, punishing the guy.
[39:00.040 --> 39:02.040]  If you think about punishment, that's...
[39:08.040 --> 39:11.040]  If you think about punishment, right?
[39:11.040 --> 39:15.040]  That's what you're doing in a punishment situation, right?
[39:15.040 --> 39:21.040]  You're saying something so that that person would stop doing that in the future, okay?
[39:21.040 --> 39:33.040]  Extinction refers to, like it says on the slide, the gradual dissipation of behavior following determination of reinforcement, okay?
[39:33.040 --> 39:42.040]  So, it's basically the process of doing away with the reinforcer that is maintaining some unwanted behavior.
[39:42.040 --> 39:53.040]  In other words, the best way for you to remember what extinction is, besides knowing these formal definitions, is that it is going to fade over time.
[39:53.040 --> 39:55.040]  It is going to become extinct.
[39:55.040 --> 39:59.040]  That's basically how you should remember this, okay?
[39:59.040 --> 40:01.040]  Does that make sense?
[40:01.040 --> 40:06.040]  But these are the formal definitions, okay?
[40:06.040 --> 40:07.040]  Alright.
[40:07.040 --> 40:10.040]  So, let's give you some examples, okay?
[40:10.040 --> 40:13.040]  So, let's talk about punishment first, okay?
[40:13.040 --> 40:20.040]  So, the behavior is an employee engages in unethical competition.
[40:20.040 --> 40:21.040]  So, what might that be?
[40:21.040 --> 40:26.040]  Maybe you're sabotaging a colleague to get ahead, right?
[40:26.040 --> 40:28.040]  So, what's the consequence?
[40:28.040 --> 40:35.040]  Well, they're suspended without pay for half a month, okay?
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.040]  So, what is the outcome?
[40:38.040 --> 40:44.040]  Well, you're going to see decrease in that unethical competition, sabotaging the colleague.
[40:44.040 --> 40:45.040]  Why?
[40:45.040 --> 40:48.040]  Because pay is so important to all of us.
[40:48.040 --> 40:51.040]  We don't want to go two weeks without pay.
[40:51.040 --> 40:53.040]  Okay, that's punishment.
[40:53.040 --> 40:55.040]  Make sense?
[40:55.040 --> 40:58.040]  Okay.
[40:58.040 --> 41:06.040]  So, this is punishment because an inversive consequence, which is the loss of income,
[41:06.040 --> 41:14.040]  the loss of status maybe, follows the unwanted behavior, reducing its future occurrence, okay?
[41:14.040 --> 41:17.040]  Alright, now let's talk about extinction, okay?
[41:17.040 --> 41:21.040]  So, again, let's go back to the unethical competition, right?
[41:21.040 --> 41:23.040]  So, you're sabotaging others.
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.040]  Maybe it's other things like, you know, you're withholding information.
[41:27.040 --> 41:30.040]  Maybe you're bending rules to outsell colleagues.
[41:30.040 --> 41:33.040]  It could be any number of things, right?
[41:33.040 --> 41:36.040]  The consequence is this.
[41:36.040 --> 41:47.040]  So, say now the company removes the policy of giving very large bonuses to the top salesperson, okay?
[41:47.040 --> 41:56.040]  So, that was kind of the reinforcement that encouraged this competitive unethical competition, right?
[41:56.040 --> 41:57.040]  So, what will happen?
[41:57.040 --> 42:06.040]  Over time, we will see the employees becoming less motivated to compete unethically, right?
[42:06.040 --> 42:09.040]  Because that reward is no longer available.
[42:09.040 --> 42:12.040]  That reinforcer is no longer available.
[42:12.040 --> 42:16.040]  The bonus, for example, is no longer available, right?
[42:16.040 --> 42:19.040]  The undesirable behavior also decreases.
[42:19.040 --> 42:20.040]  Yes?
[42:20.040 --> 42:22.040]  Well, I had a question, though.
[42:22.040 --> 42:24.040]  Does it not push you too hard?
[42:24.040 --> 42:26.040]  No, it's fine. You can ask.
[42:26.040 --> 42:31.040]  Okay, so you said before extinction works best with the substitute behavior, right?
[42:31.040 --> 42:32.040]  With what?
[42:32.040 --> 42:36.040]  With the reinforcement of a substitute behavior.
[42:36.040 --> 42:38.040]  Yes, when you remove it.
[42:38.040 --> 42:40.040]  When you remove that, yes.
[42:40.040 --> 42:43.040]  So, what would it look like here?
[42:43.040 --> 42:46.040]  So, here, so that's what I just explained, right?
[42:46.040 --> 42:55.040]  So, say unethical competition, why does unethical competition occur in the workplace?
[42:55.040 --> 43:00.040]  Why do people behave unethically in the workplace, right?
[43:00.040 --> 43:03.040]  It was a rhetorical question.
[43:03.040 --> 43:05.040]  But you could have responded to it, if you wanted.
[43:05.040 --> 43:06.040]  No, it's okay.
[43:06.040 --> 43:08.040]  No, no. Why do most people?
[43:08.040 --> 43:09.040]  Just to get ahead.
[43:09.040 --> 43:10.040]  Just to get ahead.
[43:10.040 --> 43:13.040]  Like, what is that movie called? Wall of Scream?
[43:13.040 --> 43:15.040]  What is that movie called?
[43:15.040 --> 43:16.040]  Right, yes.
[43:16.040 --> 43:18.040]  Just to come up with wall of scream.
[43:18.040 --> 43:20.040]  Right, yes. To get ahead, right?
[43:20.040 --> 43:22.040]  Why do they want to get ahead?
[43:22.040 --> 43:25.040]  Maybe because there's a large bonus associated to it, right?
[43:25.040 --> 43:31.040]  Like, maybe there is some recognition that comes from being the top salesman, right?
[43:31.040 --> 43:35.040]  But that's a reinforcer, right?
[43:35.040 --> 43:40.040]  But if you remove that reinforcer, which is what I said in the example,
[43:40.040 --> 43:47.040]  if the company removes the policy of giving you a large bonus or giving you that recognition,
[43:47.040 --> 43:50.040]  you will see a decrease in that behavior.
[43:50.040 --> 43:52.040]  Because you're no longer motivated.
[43:52.040 --> 43:54.040]  That behavior becomes extinct.
[43:54.040 --> 43:55.040]  Does that make sense?
[43:55.040 --> 43:57.040]  It fades over time.
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.040]  So no one would want to engage in this unethical behavior.
[44:00.040 --> 44:03.040]  So it doesn't have to be like a brand new behavior?
[44:03.040 --> 44:07.040]  For example, when you want to train your dog not to poop on the carpet.
[44:07.040 --> 44:10.040]  Okay, now I'm so focused on the dog.
[44:10.040 --> 44:14.040]  But yeah, you wanted to poop on the litter train instead.
[44:14.040 --> 44:17.040]  That would be the substitute, right?
[44:17.040 --> 44:18.040]  So I was just trying to think.
[44:18.040 --> 44:20.040]  It doesn't have to be like a brand new behavior.
[44:20.040 --> 44:22.040]  Sometimes it just stops doing something.
[44:22.040 --> 44:24.040]  Yes, yes. You're right in that case.
[44:24.040 --> 44:28.040]  Now I'm imagining these dogs.
[44:28.040 --> 44:31.040]  Everyone's imagining a dog now in this situation.
[44:31.040 --> 44:33.040]  But yes, you're getting the idea.
[44:33.040 --> 44:35.040]  Is everyone else getting the idea?
[44:35.040 --> 44:38.040]  We're understanding this a little bit better or no?
[44:38.040 --> 44:40.040]  Okay, good.
[44:40.040 --> 44:45.040]  Okay, so when do we use punishment effectively?
[44:45.040 --> 44:47.040]  I'm not going to read this.
[44:47.040 --> 44:50.040]  You are going to read it at your own pace.
[44:50.040 --> 44:53.040]  But I want you to remember this.
[44:53.040 --> 44:54.040]  Remember this.
[44:54.040 --> 44:56.040]  Which one is more effective?
[44:56.040 --> 44:59.040]  You need to definitely remember this.
[44:59.040 --> 45:00.040]  Intent.
[45:00.040 --> 45:01.040]  Okay?
[45:01.040 --> 45:04.040]  I want you to write down this.
[45:05.040 --> 45:10.040]  Reinforcement is more effective than punishment.
[45:10.040 --> 45:11.040]  Okay?
[45:11.040 --> 45:13.040]  Write this down.
[45:13.040 --> 45:17.040]  And then reproduce it on that damn test of yours on Monday.
[45:17.040 --> 45:18.040]  Okay?
[45:18.040 --> 45:20.040]  Where would that be?
[45:20.040 --> 45:23.040]  Where is it going to be?
[45:23.040 --> 45:26.040]  Where is it going to be?
[45:26.040 --> 45:29.040]  Who said that?
[45:29.040 --> 45:34.040]  Erica, if I'm saying write this down and reproduce it.
[45:34.040 --> 45:35.040]  Oh, sure.
[45:35.040 --> 45:36.040]  Good job.
[45:36.040 --> 45:39.040]  There's my praise.
[45:39.040 --> 45:42.040]  Is she more likely to say it?
[45:42.040 --> 45:44.040]  Today she's like, oh no.
[45:44.040 --> 45:47.040]  Okay, good.
[45:47.040 --> 45:54.040]  Okay, but if all of what I had just said went over your head, here's a summary.
[45:54.040 --> 45:55.040]  Okay?
[45:55.040 --> 46:00.040]  So this one will also explain the thing to you.
[46:00.040 --> 46:01.040]  Okay?
[46:01.040 --> 46:08.040]  It explains it using a scenario, but I really need you to drill this into your head.
[46:08.040 --> 46:09.040]  Okay?
[46:09.040 --> 46:10.040]  So understand this.
[46:10.040 --> 46:11.040]  Okay?
[46:11.040 --> 46:12.040]  Make sense?
[46:12.040 --> 46:13.040]  All right.
[46:13.040 --> 46:21.040]  So so far we've been talking about how others can be trained to learn.
[46:21.040 --> 46:22.040]  Okay?
[46:22.040 --> 46:27.040]  So we've been talking about how others learn because of what someone else does.
[46:27.040 --> 46:28.040]  Right?
[46:28.040 --> 46:29.040]  So do we reinforce them?
[46:29.040 --> 46:30.040]  Do we punish them?
[46:30.040 --> 46:35.040]  But what about learning on our own?
[46:35.040 --> 46:40.040]  This is where the social cognitive theory comes into place.
[46:40.040 --> 46:41.040]  Okay?
[46:41.040 --> 46:44.040]  So the social cognitive theory, I'm just going to prevent you from reading out one.
[46:44.040 --> 46:53.040]  Social cognitive theory, it shows that we can learn by thinking, observing, and regulating ourselves.
[46:53.040 --> 46:54.040]  Okay?
[46:55.040 --> 47:05.040]  So it basically emphasizes that the cognitive processes involved in, it emphasizes the cognitive,
[47:05.040 --> 47:08.040]  what happens in your head, right?
[47:08.040 --> 47:11.040]  Processes involved in learning and behavior.
[47:11.040 --> 47:12.040]  Okay?
[47:12.040 --> 47:16.040]  So people are not passive responders to stimuli.
[47:16.040 --> 47:19.040]  Like they are in the upper condition, right?
[47:19.040 --> 47:21.040]  You're responding to some stimulus.
[47:21.040 --> 47:28.040]  But here you are active agents in shaping your own actions.
[47:28.040 --> 47:29.040]  Okay?
[47:29.040 --> 47:35.040]  So according to this particular theory, people can learn in a number of different ways.
[47:35.040 --> 47:36.040]  Okay?
[47:36.040 --> 47:39.040]  One would be by observing the behavior of others.
[47:39.040 --> 47:43.040]  This is also known as observational learning or modeling.
[47:43.040 --> 47:44.040]  Okay?
[47:44.040 --> 47:49.040]  So we don't have to experience everything ourselves.
[47:50.040 --> 47:55.040]  We can watch others and we can learn from their successes and their mistakes.
[47:55.040 --> 47:56.040]  Right?
[47:56.040 --> 48:00.040]  So for example, like a new employee, right?
[48:00.040 --> 48:01.040]  What do they do?
[48:01.040 --> 48:08.040]  They watch how a colleague deals with a difficult client and then models that approach later on.
[48:08.040 --> 48:09.040]  Okay?
[48:09.040 --> 48:12.040]  So you're basically engaging in observational learning.
[48:12.040 --> 48:16.040]  You can also regulate your own behavior.
[48:16.040 --> 48:17.040]  Okay?
[48:17.040 --> 48:20.040]  You can do so in a number of different ways as well.
[48:20.040 --> 48:28.040]  So you can visit the cognitive processes such as anticipating consequences.
[48:28.040 --> 48:30.040]  Like you're thinking ahead of time.
[48:30.040 --> 48:31.040]  Right?
[48:31.040 --> 48:37.040]  So for example, if I skip this task, it might hurt my performance review.
[48:37.040 --> 48:38.040]  Okay?
[48:38.040 --> 48:40.040]  You can set goals.
[48:41.040 --> 48:50.040]  So you're kind of creating your personal standards or your targets to strive forward or to strive towards.
[48:50.040 --> 48:52.040]  You can monitor performance.
[48:52.040 --> 48:58.040]  So you're paying attention to how well we are doing, what needs to improve.
[48:58.040 --> 49:00.040]  And then you can reward yourself.
[49:00.040 --> 49:02.040]  Also known as self-rewarding.
[49:02.040 --> 49:03.040]  Right?
[49:03.040 --> 49:06.040]  So you're giving yourself positive feedback.
[49:06.040 --> 49:07.040]  Right?
[49:07.040 --> 49:09.040]  Or whatever it may be.
[49:09.040 --> 49:14.040]  Maybe it's like taking a break after a big task or something of that sort.
[49:14.040 --> 49:15.040]  Okay?
[49:15.040 --> 49:17.040]  All right.
[49:17.040 --> 49:26.040]  Now, according to the social cognitive theory, human behavior can best be described as a system of triadic,
[49:26.040 --> 49:29.040]  reciprocal causation.
[49:29.040 --> 49:31.040]  What a mouthful.
[49:31.040 --> 49:39.040]  But what that basically means is that personal factors as well as environmental factors must work together
[49:39.040 --> 49:43.040]  and interact to influence people's behaviors.
[49:43.040 --> 49:44.040]  Okay?
[49:44.040 --> 49:51.040]  And then the other thing is that it's bidirectional, which basically means that people's behaviors influence
[49:51.040 --> 49:55.040]  these personal factors and environment as well.
[49:55.040 --> 50:02.040]  Okay, so not only does personal factors and environmental factors influence us with our behaviors,
[50:02.040 --> 50:08.040]  but our behaviors can influence these personal and environmental factors as well.
[50:08.040 --> 50:09.040]  Okay?
[50:09.040 --> 50:10.040]  All right.
[50:10.040 --> 50:14.040]  So now this is what I need you to take note of.
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.040]  I mean, just hear me out because the next few slides actually give you the definition.
[50:18.040 --> 50:19.040]  Okay?
[50:19.040 --> 50:28.040]  But according to Albert Bendura, who is basically the person who came up with the social cognitive theory,
[50:28.040 --> 50:30.040]  involves three components.
[50:30.040 --> 50:37.040]  There is observational learning, there is self-efficacy beliefs, and then there is self-regulation.
[50:37.040 --> 50:39.040]  Okay?
[50:39.040 --> 50:42.040]  So observational learning, what is that?
[50:42.040 --> 50:43.040]  Okay?
[50:43.040 --> 50:48.040]  It's the process of basically imitating the behavior of others.
[50:48.040 --> 50:49.040]  Okay?
[50:49.040 --> 50:55.040]  It's a form of learning that occurs by observing, by imagining the behaviors of others,
[50:55.040 --> 51:00.040]  rather than by having direct experiences on it.
[51:00.040 --> 51:02.040]  Okay?
[51:02.040 --> 51:05.040]  So you're kind of like observing the situation.
[51:08.040 --> 51:09.040]  Okay.
[51:09.040 --> 51:15.040]  Now, the best models for observing, this is what research shows,
[51:15.040 --> 51:22.040]  are those that are attractive, credible components, competent, and high status.
[51:22.040 --> 51:24.040]  Okay?
[51:24.040 --> 51:32.040]  So when you observe someone with credibility, meaning if you were to teach OBHR and you observed me,
[51:32.040 --> 51:37.040]  you're more likely to take that into account.
[51:37.040 --> 51:39.040]  Does that make sense?
[51:39.040 --> 51:41.040]  Okay.
[51:41.040 --> 51:48.040]  The other things you have to note is that vivid, memorable behavior is often imitated as well.
[51:48.040 --> 51:49.040]  Right?
[51:49.040 --> 51:58.040]  And the extent of observational learning really is the means by which learning and organization occur.
[51:58.040 --> 52:03.040]  It suggests to us that managers should pay more attention to this process.
[52:03.040 --> 52:06.040]  But anyway, let's move on.
[52:06.040 --> 52:07.040]  Okay?
[52:07.040 --> 52:09.040]  So that's observational learning.
[52:09.040 --> 52:14.040]  You're observing the behavior of others, rather than engaging in it yourself.
[52:14.040 --> 52:22.040]  Self-efficacy, this is basically the belief that you have about your ability to perform the task.
[52:22.040 --> 52:24.040]  Okay?
[52:24.040 --> 52:28.040]  So how confident am I that I'm going to actually do well on the task?
[52:28.040 --> 52:30.040]  That's self-efficacy.
[52:30.040 --> 52:32.040]  Okay?
[52:33.040 --> 52:39.040]  And it is a result of four sources of information.
[52:39.040 --> 52:40.040]  Okay?
[52:40.040 --> 52:50.040]  There is the performance mastery, observation, verbal persuasion, and social influence, and physiological state.
[52:50.040 --> 52:56.040]  So performance mastery, this is the experience and the success of performing the task.
[52:56.040 --> 52:57.040]  Okay?
[52:57.040 --> 53:07.040]  So I've performed this task, and I've already, you know, I've experienced this task before, and I've been successful at it.
[53:07.040 --> 53:10.040]  Observation of others performing the task.
[53:10.040 --> 53:12.040]  Right?
[53:12.040 --> 53:16.040]  Verbal persuasion and encouragement is basically the third one.
[53:16.040 --> 53:18.040]  Others say you can do it.
[53:18.040 --> 53:19.040]  Right?
[53:19.040 --> 53:26.040]  And then one's physiological state or emotional state can also have an influence.
[53:26.040 --> 53:27.040]  Okay?
[53:27.040 --> 53:30.040]  So what's your comfort level?
[53:30.040 --> 53:31.040]  Are you stressed?
[53:31.040 --> 53:33.040]  Are you relaxed?
[53:35.040 --> 53:36.040]  Okay?
[53:36.040 --> 53:44.040]  So performance mastery is, I've done this in the before, in the past, I've been very successful at it.
[53:44.040 --> 53:46.040]  Okay?
[53:46.040 --> 53:50.040]  Observation is, others are doing it too.
[53:50.040 --> 53:54.040]  Verbal persuasion or social influence really has to do with encouragement.
[53:54.040 --> 53:57.040]  Others are telling me I can do it.
[53:57.040 --> 54:01.040]  And then physiological state is just how are you feeling in the moment?
[54:01.040 --> 54:02.040]  Are you relaxed?
[54:02.040 --> 54:03.040]  Are you calm?
[54:03.040 --> 54:10.040]  All of those influence your belief of how successful you will be at the task.
[54:10.040 --> 54:12.040]  Make sense?
[54:14.040 --> 54:15.040]  Yeah?
[54:15.040 --> 54:16.040]  Okay.
[54:16.040 --> 54:17.040]  Easy peasy.
[54:17.040 --> 54:18.040]  Okay.
[54:18.040 --> 54:19.040]  Okay.
[54:19.040 --> 54:23.040]  Self-regulation, and I will talk about this in a few minutes.
[54:23.040 --> 54:24.040]  Right?
[54:24.040 --> 54:25.040]  Okay.
[54:25.040 --> 54:31.040]  So self-regulation, and if you don't understand me, please go to the textbook to understand this a little bit better.
[54:31.040 --> 54:33.040]  Put an asterisk around here.
[54:33.040 --> 54:34.040]  Okay?
[54:34.040 --> 54:38.040]  Put an asterisk around self-regulation if you're not able to understand me.
[54:38.040 --> 54:44.040]  So self-regulation really has to do with how you regulate your behavior.
[54:45.040 --> 54:46.040]  Okay?
[54:46.040 --> 54:53.040]  And there's two things you have to keep in mind, which is discrepancy reduction and discrepancy production.
[54:53.040 --> 54:54.040]  Okay?
[54:55.040 --> 54:58.040]  So let's break this down a little bit further.
[54:58.040 --> 55:07.040]  So a key part of this process is people's pursuit of self-set goals that guide their behavior.
[55:07.040 --> 55:08.040]  Okay?
[55:09.040 --> 55:33.040]  So when there is a discrepancy between one's goal and performance, individuals are motivated to modify their behavior in pursuit of goal attainment.
[55:33.040 --> 55:35.040]  Okay?
[55:35.040 --> 55:39.040]  And this is known as discrepancy reduction.
[55:39.040 --> 55:40.040]  Okay?
[55:40.040 --> 55:52.040]  So discrepancy reduction is basically where you see a discrepancy between your own goal and performance.
[55:56.040 --> 55:57.040]  Okay?
[55:57.040 --> 56:03.040]  So you see a discrepancy between your own goals, you see a discrepancy between your own goals and performance.
[56:03.040 --> 56:04.040]  So what are you going to do?
[56:04.040 --> 56:06.040]  You're going to modify your behavior.
[56:06.040 --> 56:07.040]  Right?
[56:07.040 --> 56:09.040]  Because you want to attain that goal.
[56:09.040 --> 56:13.040]  So that is known as discrepancy reduction.
[56:18.040 --> 56:19.040]  Okay.
[56:19.040 --> 56:30.040]  Now, when individuals attain their goals, right, they are likely to set even higher or more challenging goals.
[56:31.040 --> 56:32.040]  Okay?
[56:32.040 --> 56:36.040]  So once I've attained the goal, I'm going to work harder.
[56:36.040 --> 56:37.040]  Hopefully that's you.
[56:37.040 --> 56:38.040]  Right?
[56:38.040 --> 56:39.040]  I'm going to work harder.
[56:39.040 --> 56:41.040]  I'm going to have a new goal.
[56:41.040 --> 56:44.040]  I'm going to have more challenging goals.
[56:44.040 --> 56:48.040]  That is known as discrepancy reduction.
[56:50.040 --> 56:51.040]  Okay?
[56:51.040 --> 56:55.040]  So what are we suggesting with this?
[56:55.040 --> 57:00.040]  Do we both understand discrepancy reduction and then discrepancy production?
[57:00.040 --> 57:01.040]  Right?
[57:01.040 --> 57:02.040]  Okay.
[57:02.040 --> 57:13.040]  So in this way, people are continuously engaging in a process of setting goals in pursuit of even higher levels of performance.
[57:14.040 --> 57:15.040]  Okay?
[57:15.040 --> 57:27.040]  So in the self-regulatory process, both the discrepancy reduction and the discrepancy production are the, they are like the heart of this process.
[57:27.040 --> 57:29.040]  You need them both.
[57:29.040 --> 57:30.040]  Okay?
[57:30.040 --> 57:31.040]  So let's go here.
[57:31.040 --> 57:32.040]  Okay?
[57:32.040 --> 57:33.040]  So this is an example.
[57:33.040 --> 57:36.040]  So you're currently engaging in some sort of behavior.
[57:36.040 --> 57:38.040]  And you compare it to a standard.
[57:38.040 --> 57:43.040]  So you compare it to, you compare your goal to the performance.
[57:43.040 --> 57:48.040]  You notice a discrepancy, right?
[57:48.040 --> 57:50.040]  You modify it.
[57:50.040 --> 57:52.040]  You change your behavior.
[57:52.040 --> 57:53.040]  Okay?
[57:53.040 --> 57:56.040]  And now you're going to attain that goal.
[57:56.040 --> 57:59.040]  So now you need to set another goal.
[57:59.040 --> 58:02.040]  And that's where the production comes in, discrepancy production.
[58:02.040 --> 58:07.040]  So say our goal is to like feel prepared for the exam on Monday.
[58:07.040 --> 58:08.040]  Good.
[58:08.040 --> 58:13.040]  Where our behavior currently is that maybe we're working on it an hour, hour and a half per day.
[58:13.040 --> 58:18.040]  But we're noticing now we're not really on pace to like meet that goal.
[58:18.040 --> 58:19.040]  Yes.
[58:19.040 --> 58:20.040]  So like.
[58:20.040 --> 58:22.040]  So that would be what?
[58:22.040 --> 58:24.040]  Discrepancy or like.
[58:24.040 --> 58:25.040]  Yes, reduction.
[58:25.040 --> 58:26.040]  Reduction in bio.
[58:26.040 --> 58:29.040]  You can reduce it by maybe working more like two hours a day.
[58:29.040 --> 58:30.040]  Okay.
[58:30.040 --> 58:31.040]  So you change your behavior.
[58:31.040 --> 58:32.040]  You modify it.
[58:32.040 --> 58:33.040]  Right?
[58:33.040 --> 58:35.040]  So now you have created a new goal.
[58:35.040 --> 58:38.040]  And that is discrepancy production.
[58:38.040 --> 58:39.040]  Make sense?
[58:39.040 --> 58:40.040]  Okay.
[58:40.040 --> 58:42.040]  So you're studying for the midterm.
[58:42.040 --> 58:43.040]  Right?
[58:43.040 --> 58:48.040]  You monitor your current studying behavior.
[58:48.040 --> 58:51.040]  Compare that to your goal.
[58:51.040 --> 58:52.040]  Right?
[58:52.040 --> 58:53.040]  So what happens?
[58:53.040 --> 58:56.040]  In your case, you will study harder.
[58:56.040 --> 58:57.040]  Right?
[58:57.040 --> 58:59.040]  And then you will set a newer goal.
[58:59.040 --> 59:02.040]  That's basically what this process is talking about.
[59:02.040 --> 59:03.040]  Okay?
[59:03.040 --> 59:08.040]  So you notice a discrepancy between your goal and your behavior.
[59:08.040 --> 59:11.040]  You then modify your behavior.
[59:11.040 --> 59:14.040]  Now you have kind of achieved the goal.
[59:14.040 --> 59:16.040]  But not so much in the studying sense.
[59:16.040 --> 59:17.040]  You're going to constantly.
[59:17.040 --> 59:18.040]  Right?
[59:18.040 --> 59:19.040]  You sort of achieved it.
[59:19.040 --> 59:21.040]  But now you set another goal for yourself.
[59:21.040 --> 59:22.040]  And you just stop there.
[59:22.040 --> 59:23.040]  Does that make sense?
[59:23.040 --> 59:24.040]  Okay.
[59:24.040 --> 59:25.040]  So we understand that.
[59:25.040 --> 59:26.040]  Right?
[59:26.040 --> 59:30.040]  So you're kind of regulating your own behavior in that situation.
[59:30.040 --> 59:33.040]  Okay?
[59:33.040 --> 59:36.040]  Any other questions here?
[59:36.040 --> 59:37.040]  No?
[59:37.040 --> 59:38.040]  Okay.
[59:38.040 --> 59:39.040]  Good.
[59:39.040 --> 59:40.040]  Okay.
[59:40.040 --> 59:42.040]  So self-regulation involves a number of different things.
[59:42.040 --> 59:43.040]  Okay?
[59:43.040 --> 59:49.040]  And so you can collect some observation data so you can monitor your current behavior.
[59:49.040 --> 59:55.040]  You can observe models so you see how other people are doing it.
[59:55.040 --> 59:57.040]  You can set behavioral goals.
[59:57.040 --> 01:00:04.040]  So goal setting to create the discrepancy, to reduce the discrepancy.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.040]  You can recurse to desired behavior.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.040]  And then you can apply self-reinforcement.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.040]  Right?
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.040]  So you can be like, I'm going to praise myself or I'm going to take a break or whatever.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.040]  Does that make sense?
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.040]  So these are techniques in which you can regulate your behavior.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.040]  But don't confuse this with this process.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.040]  Make sense?
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.040]  This is a process of how self-regulation unfolds.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.040]  Right?
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.040]  But these are techniques in which you can self-regulate.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.040]  Those are two different things.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:39.040]  Does that make sense?
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.040]  Do we have any questions?
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.040]  Okay.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.040]  So from this slide deck, what is important to know?
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.040]  What do you think?
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.040]  Remind me again.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.040]  Someone tell me.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:53.040]  I've lost my mic.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.040]  Yes?
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.040]  Discrepancy reduction and discrepancy production and the fact that one of them is the process
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.040]  and the other one is just the technique.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.040]  Good.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.040]  Okay.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.040]  So you're going to remember this slide.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.040]  Right?
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:09.040]  Well, not the slide, but you're going to remember discrepancy reduction, discrepancy production.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.040]  Again, if you didn't understand what I said in class, go to your textbook and understand it.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.040]  Right?
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040]  Good.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.040]  All right.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040]  What else did I ask you to remember?
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]  Yes?
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.040]  Not all of the words are reinforcements.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.040]  Okay.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.040]  Sure.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.040]  So know the common mistakes.
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040]  Okay.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040]  What else?
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040]  There was like someone I said, Erica, sweetheart.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.040]  Using punishment effectively.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040]  Good.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040]  No, no, no.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.040]  Reinforcement is more effective than punishment.
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.040]  Okay?
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.040]  But that was slide under it.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.040]  Yes.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.040]  Okay.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.040]  Good.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.040]  Reinforcement is more effective than punishment.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.040]  I don't think we have that moment.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.040]  Okay.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.040]  Good.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.040]  Good.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.040]  Good.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.040]  Good.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.040]  Okay.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.040]  And what was the other thing?
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.040]  What was the last thing I asked you to pay attention?
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.040]  Yes?
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.040]  Before learning processes.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040]  Good.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.040]  Right?
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.040]  That grid.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.040]  Right?
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.040]  Know the reinforcers and then know the punishment versus extinction.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040]  Probabilities to increase and decrease behavior.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.040]  Good?
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.040]  Okay.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.040]  Now I'm going to move on.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.040]  Okay.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.040]  So I'm going to move on to the next slide.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.040]  Okay.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040]  So I'm going to move on to the next slide.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.040]  Okay.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040]  So I'm going to move on to the next slide.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040]  Okay.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040]  So I'm going to move on to the next slide.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.040]  Okay.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040]  So I'm going to move on and we're going to talk about what's important in the next,
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.040]  this thing.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040]  Let me see if I can actually pull this out of you and see if I can finish in like 20
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040]  minutes.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.040]  The first idea.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.040]  All right.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040]  Let's do this out.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.040]  I usually write this into class.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.040]  So this chapter is all about perception, attribution, diversity.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.040]  Let me ask you this, the question I asked you that you said, how do you understand
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:30.400]  I usually break this into class.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.480]  So this chapter is all about perception, attribution, and diversity.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.480]  Let me ask you this.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.480]  Here is a question.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.360]  I will tell you who this is afterwards.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:47.200]  But your first impression, what is, for those who haven't participated yet, what do you
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.960]  think his occupation is?
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.960]  Yes?
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.280]  Like a gas station worker.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.320]  A gas station worker?
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.320]  Anyone else?
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.320]  Artist.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.320]  Artist.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.320]  Okay, sure, anyone else?
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.320]  A mother.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.320]  Okay, sure, anyone else?
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320]  Do you want to say anything?
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320]  What do you think his personality is like?
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320]  Very like, careless.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.320]  Careless.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.320]  Okay, next.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.320]  Aggressive.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.320]  Aggressive.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320]  Okay, yes.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.320]  Sure?
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.320]  Yeah?
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.320]  Maybe lazy.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.320]  Lazy?
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.320]  I think he looks pretty nice.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.320]  He looks, okay.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320]  Alright, he looks nice.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320]  Okay, sure.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.320]  What do you think are his likes and dislikes?
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320]  Those who, okay, yes, go on.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.320]  Oh, nothing.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.320]  Nothing.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.320]  Okay, so what do you think his personality is like?
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.320]  Very like, careless.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.320]  Okay, sure.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.320]  Aggressive.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.320]  Aggressive.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.320]  Okay, yes.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.320]  Sure?
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.320]  Yeah?
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.320]  Maybe lazy.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.320]  Lazy?
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.320]  I think he looks pretty nice.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.320]  He looks, okay.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.320]  Alright, he looks nice.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.320]  Okay, sure.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.320]  Meth?
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.320]  Anyone else?
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.320]  Come on, easy.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.320]  If you haven't participated, put up your hand.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.320]  Yes?
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.320]  Like, gaming.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.320]  Gaming?
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.320]  Okay.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.320]  Who else hasn't participated?
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.320]  Cocaine.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320]  Cocaine, sure.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.320]  Rock music.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320]  Rock music.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.320]  So all four, you've participated.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.320]  What does he mean by that?
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.320]  Mona.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.320]  Mona.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.320]  Did you participate?
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.320]  No.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.320]  Okay, I'm sorry to pick on you.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320]  Just me.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320]  No, it's okay.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320]  Yeah, we did participate.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.320]  Okay, so what do you think his personality is like?
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.320]  Very like, careless.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.320]  Very like, careless.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.320]  Okay, so what do you think his personality is like?
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.320]  I'm going to say video games as well.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.320]  Video games.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320]  Okay.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.320]  Yes?
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.320]  Lives on employment insurance?
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.320]  It lives on employment insurance.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.320]  Okay.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.320]  Did everyone participate there?
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.320]  Yes, we did.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.320]  Participation here was done.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.320]  Participate.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320]  Trenton, did you participate?
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.320]  Do you want me to say something about him, though?
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.320]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.320]  Any of the questions?
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320]  Any of the questions?
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320]  No.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320]  I don't know.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320]  I already know who he is.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]  Oh, okay, forget.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320]  Okay.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.320]  Did everyone participate there?
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.320]  Did all?
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.320]  Did you participate?
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.320]  He looks happy.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.320]  He looks happy, okay.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.320]  Anyone else?
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.320]  Everyone participated.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.320]  Oh, yes, sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.320]  He looks unemployed.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.320]  Unemployed.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.320]  He does drugs.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.320]  Okay, good.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.320]  Everyone participated today, okay?
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.320]  Okay, thank you.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:05:06.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:29.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:54.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:06:19.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:44.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:07:09.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:36.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:08:03.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:30.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:56.320]  Okay, so that's it for this session.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.960]  What are the factors that influence perception?
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.240]  Well, there's three components that we need to consider.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:09.880]  So there's the perceiver, the target, and the situation.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.640]  And this is what I will do.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.960]  For this particular slide, I will actually
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.440]  provide you with my notes.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:20.560]  So let's just hold off of that, because I
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.600]  feel like you will just, but here, let
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.280]  me tell you in a nutshell what it is.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.960]  So actually, no, I'm not going to tell you.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.400]  Just wait for my notes.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.400]  I'm sorry.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.560]  He's like, you're stressing me out.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.920]  I'm stressed out, because I want to get through this as quickly
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.680]  as possible.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.760]  But I'll give you my notes.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.040]  I'll give you my notes for that slide,
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.880]  so you'll see it later today.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.400]  Let's talk about perceptual biases and shortcuts.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.560]  Do I have to give you the definition of leech?
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.060]  I do.
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.840]  How amazing is that?
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.280]  So I don't have to even go through that.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.320]  Speed through it.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.240]  But basically, we use a number of different shortcuts
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.640]  when we're judging others.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.960]  And an understanding of these shortcuts
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.240]  can help us towards recognizing when they might
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.880]  lead to significant distortion.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.960]  So this is what I'm going to have you do.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:19.000]  I'm going to have you read through these slides.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.200]  And if there is something that doesn't make sense to you,
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.800]  you ask me next class.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:30.360]  These might be on your multiple choice.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:34.680]  So to read through it, ask yourself, does this make sense?
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.360]  Does what Santa has on the slide make sense?
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.160]  And if it doesn't, you ask me next class.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.080]  All right.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.800]  Stereotyping is another one that you should definitely know.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.000]  And I don't have time.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  But let's go back to this.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:49.500]  Oh, no.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.880]  Let me first talk to us.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.320]  OK, do we know what stereotyping is?
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.760]  In layman terms, what is it?
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:03.120]  What we just did, like 10 minutes ago?
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:03.620]  Yeah.
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.320]  OK, good.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.760]  OK, so we stereotype.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.200]  So we took a personal characteristic,
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.320]  and we basically stereotyped, right?
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.560]  OK.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.440]  So I've actually told you what stereotyping is on this slide.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.960]  So just understand it.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.720]  But let's go back to this person.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.240]  Trendin, sorry to put you on this spot
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.960]  and to make you so stressed out because I
