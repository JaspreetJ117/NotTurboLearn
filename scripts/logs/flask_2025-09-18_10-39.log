[00:00.000 --> 00:03.240]  is like everyone, and it's not mine,
[00:03.240 --> 00:06.120]  so it's all awesome for me.
[00:06.120 --> 00:08.440]  You can do a lot of questions all the way.
[00:08.440 --> 00:10.920]  And remember, you don't have a tense on the quiz,
[00:10.920 --> 00:12.880]  you have a tense per question.
[00:12.880 --> 00:14.480]  So you can open it, you'll have a few questions,
[00:14.480 --> 00:16.240]  close it, come back with it.
[00:16.240 --> 00:17.520]  That is fine.
[00:17.520 --> 00:19.520]  If something goes wrong, let us know.
[00:19.520 --> 00:21.200]  We'll gladly collect the work out.
[00:21.200 --> 00:23.000]  We will figure something out.
[00:23.000 --> 00:26.120]  It's a little gnarly to get two attempts per question.
[00:26.120 --> 00:27.520]  So you should know how to open it up
[00:27.520 --> 00:28.360]  and come back with it.
[00:28.360 --> 00:29.200]  Go on.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.480]  And I'll tell you today, if we get far enough,
[00:34.480 --> 00:35.960]  I think we will.
[00:35.960 --> 00:37.960]  We'll see how it goes.
[00:37.960 --> 00:39.920]  I'm going to give you a whole length of now.
[00:39.920 --> 00:42.400]  I'm going to give you a whole length of now.
[00:42.400 --> 00:44.360]  The question is about the work on the quiz.
[00:56.360 --> 00:57.360]  All right.
[00:57.600 --> 01:02.520]  At the end of the last class, we did Z-sports.
[01:02.520 --> 01:06.800]  They are easy to calculate from that table we built.
[01:06.800 --> 01:09.200]  Something's wrong with the recording,
[01:09.200 --> 01:11.080]  and they're not at the end of the recording,
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.600]  but I turned on another recording,
[01:12.600 --> 01:16.680]  so there is now like a one minute video.
[01:16.680 --> 01:20.200]  If you're reviewing the recording later,
[01:20.200 --> 01:22.680]  you can see on the Z-sports, you're calculating.
[01:22.680 --> 01:24.160]  They're hiding the question here.
[01:24.160 --> 01:29.920]  And now, what do we have to do for a factor three
[01:29.920 --> 01:31.400]  exposition variation?
[01:36.400 --> 01:40.640]  People don't use this a lot, but every now and then,
[01:40.640 --> 01:43.120]  someone cites it.
[01:43.120 --> 01:44.600]  Did you take that in mind?
[01:44.600 --> 01:46.600]  Did you take that in mind?
[01:46.600 --> 01:48.600]  Did you take that in mind?
[01:49.040 --> 01:53.440]  It often shows up that I see people
[01:53.440 --> 01:58.440]  finding out in the context of gambling, in the stock markets,
[01:58.440 --> 02:00.440]  like evaluating how it's the actual price,
[02:00.440 --> 02:02.440]  and times it's your typical in the variations
[02:02.440 --> 02:05.920]  instead of the standard deviations.
[02:05.920 --> 02:08.640]  And the idea is that you're looking at this
[02:08.640 --> 02:10.120]  where all these things have units.
[02:10.120 --> 02:12.640]  They all depend on whether you're talking about dollars
[02:12.640 --> 02:15.400]  or A's, or whatever else we're talking about.
[02:15.400 --> 02:18.400]  Maybe we could have a unit that's measured in variations.
[02:18.400 --> 02:21.400]  So that if I told you that something had a coefficient
[02:21.400 --> 02:24.400]  variation of n, you would have an idea that it was like,
[02:24.400 --> 02:25.400]  oh, that is risky.
[02:25.400 --> 02:27.880]  But if it had a coefficient variation of like 0.1,
[02:27.880 --> 02:30.360]  then it's not risky.
[02:30.360 --> 02:38.360]  And so, coefficient variation is a unit that has a risk.
[02:48.400 --> 02:58.360]  So I have an annotation for it.
[02:58.360 --> 03:02.360]  It's a text called C. OK.
[03:09.360 --> 03:09.860]  OK.
[03:09.860 --> 03:14.360]  So all you do is you take the standard deviation
[03:15.320 --> 03:19.320]  calculated and divide it by the average calculated.
[03:19.320 --> 03:24.800]  You multiply by 100 to get it as a first set.
[03:35.800 --> 03:39.800]  If you bother with numbers, you did that last class.
[03:40.240 --> 03:45.240]  And then maybe we'll do one theory for a sample.
[03:45.240 --> 03:46.720]  Stealing is wrong.
[03:46.720 --> 03:47.220]  What?
[03:47.220 --> 03:50.200]  Stealing is wrong.
[03:50.200 --> 03:51.200]  What is stealing?
[03:51.200 --> 03:52.200]  What the fuck?
[03:56.200 --> 03:57.680]  OK.
[03:57.680 --> 03:58.180]  Camera.
[04:02.160 --> 04:03.160]  We're really quick.
[04:04.000 --> 04:15.000]  So last class, we had an example where s was 0.1.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  Yeah.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  We had an example where s was 5.36.
[04:32.840 --> 04:34.840]  The average time was 7.
[04:35.680 --> 05:04.680]  So you take your s or sigma, number one,
[05:05.520 --> 05:07.520]  and you calculate it, and then you divide by the average.
[05:10.520 --> 05:12.520]  Multiply it by 100.
[05:12.520 --> 05:15.520]  And that gives you the score.
[05:15.520 --> 05:17.520]  Usually it's given as a percentage.
[05:21.520 --> 05:25.520]  So 5.36 divided by 9.7.
[05:25.520 --> 05:29.520]  And I get 0.5523.
[05:35.520 --> 05:36.020]  OK.
[05:49.520 --> 05:54.520]  And then I can say simple things like,
[05:55.360 --> 06:06.360]  CV well above 100% is considered variable or maybe
[06:06.360 --> 06:12.840]  volatile, risky.
[06:12.840 --> 06:23.840]  And a CV much lower than 100% is not.
[06:25.320 --> 06:29.320]  And I'm not giving you specific values
[06:29.320 --> 06:31.320]  because it depends on the context.
[06:34.320 --> 06:38.320]  And the text doesn't have anything about this.
[06:38.320 --> 06:40.320]  And you're not hesitant.
[06:40.320 --> 06:50.320]  It's kind of like a, generally, let CV be 4.
[06:54.520 --> 06:55.020]  OK.
[07:10.520 --> 07:12.520]  It usually takes a lot of work to get it.
[07:12.520 --> 07:15.520]  You've got to calculate the gap and do the standard deviation.
[07:15.520 --> 07:19.520]  But once you have those, it's more or less a variable.
[07:25.520 --> 07:26.020]  OK.
[07:26.020 --> 07:29.000]  Problem solved.
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  This is one of the most fun chapters in the game story.
[07:33.000 --> 07:34.000]  I had fun.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  And we should probably, I like to do this.
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  Remember I said at the beginning of the course,
[07:42.000 --> 07:43.480]  like, there's a reason we do this?
[07:43.480 --> 07:43.980]  Well, yes.
[07:43.980 --> 07:44.980]  That's how it works.
[07:44.980 --> 07:47.480]  There's a lot of different things in front of it.
[07:47.480 --> 07:50.960]  What do we do?
[07:50.960 --> 07:53.460]  And all of the definitions of the things I'll give you,
[07:53.900 --> 07:55.900]  I'll leave you with a question for a while.
[07:58.900 --> 08:04.900]  How likely, if there's a problem,
[08:04.900 --> 08:18.900]  how likely is it that the top card of a scuffled,
[08:19.340 --> 08:21.340]  standard 52 card deck?
[08:25.340 --> 08:27.340]  We've also got bridge decks.
[08:27.340 --> 08:31.340]  They are used for poker or any other card games.
[08:31.340 --> 08:33.340]  Other parts of the world, including Europe,
[08:33.340 --> 08:34.340]  have similar decks.
[08:34.340 --> 08:36.340]  But they sometimes they don't call them decks.
[08:36.340 --> 08:38.340]  They call them something else.
[08:38.340 --> 08:40.340]  And then other places have different decks,
[08:40.340 --> 08:42.340]  but we have a 52 card deck here.
[08:42.340 --> 08:47.340]  And it's ace.
[08:49.340 --> 08:58.340]  So the 52 card deck has four suits,
[08:58.340 --> 09:01.340]  a heart and clubs.
[09:01.340 --> 09:06.340]  It has 13 denominations, ace, which is a kind of a one,
[09:06.340 --> 09:09.340]  two to 10, jack and king.
[09:09.340 --> 09:13.340]  If you know the answer to this question,
[09:13.340 --> 09:15.340]  the next half an hour it's going to be a little dull.
[09:15.340 --> 09:18.340]  But we've got to go through it and we've got to define
[09:18.780 --> 09:21.780]  definitions and show you how to calculate it.
[09:21.780 --> 09:26.780]  When I was your age, I knew how to do this because I was
[09:26.780 --> 09:28.780]  probably better at math than you.
[09:35.780 --> 09:39.780]  One of my secrets is that I almost developed a gambling
[09:39.780 --> 09:42.780]  problem.
[09:42.780 --> 09:45.780]  I say almost because I got better and better at math
[09:46.220 --> 09:49.220]  and I realized that gambling is a wrong way.
[09:49.220 --> 09:51.220]  But I had a good way of...
[10:16.220 --> 10:19.220]  I hear some of you like to gamble.
[10:19.220 --> 10:22.220]  They show up at the cash register.
[10:22.220 --> 10:25.220]  People will not talk about that.
[10:25.220 --> 10:28.220]  This...
[10:28.220 --> 10:31.220]  What about things we don't do?
[10:35.220 --> 10:38.220]  Okay.
[10:38.220 --> 10:41.220]  Possibility...
[10:41.660 --> 10:44.660]  Possibility...
[11:04.660 --> 11:07.660]  The relative likelihood that an event will occur...
[11:11.660 --> 11:14.660]  We're going to have to define the probability.
[11:28.660 --> 11:33.660]  So you could substitute the word probability into this
[11:36.660 --> 11:39.660]  question and say what is the probability of that?
[11:40.100 --> 11:43.100]  What is the probability...
[11:55.100 --> 11:58.100]  So those are the things.
[11:58.100 --> 12:01.100]  That's how we understand the probability.
[12:01.100 --> 12:04.100]  What is the likelihood?
[12:04.100 --> 12:07.100]  What is the probability that something will happen?
[12:07.540 --> 12:10.540]  What is the probability that something will happen?
[12:14.540 --> 12:17.540]  Propagation...
[12:22.540 --> 12:25.540]  A is the event.
[12:25.540 --> 12:28.540]  Then P of A is the probability.
[12:37.540 --> 12:40.540]  With a requirement...
[12:46.540 --> 12:49.540]  That the probability is between zero and one inclusive.
[12:52.540 --> 12:55.540]  So you can come up with some events.
[12:59.540 --> 13:02.540]  Like what is the probability that you draw a business card?
[13:02.980 --> 13:05.980]  A business card...
[13:05.980 --> 13:08.980]  Not that you can card X, but one is probably zero.
[13:10.980 --> 13:13.980]  Or what is the probability that you draw an A card?
[13:13.980 --> 13:16.980]  It will...
[13:17.420 --> 13:20.420]  What is the probability that you draw an A card?
[13:20.420 --> 13:23.420]  It will be a little bit more than the probability.
[13:23.420 --> 13:26.420]  The probability is a little bit more than the probability.
[13:31.420 --> 13:34.420]  I don't think too much with that.
[13:37.420 --> 13:40.420]  No, no, I think it's a little bit more than that.
[13:42.420 --> 13:45.420]  I'm just going to say it's a little bit more than that.
[13:47.420 --> 13:50.420]  I'm supposed to define...
[13:50.420 --> 13:53.420]  Elemental things like an experiment and a test.
[13:53.420 --> 13:56.420]  So we should do that quickly.
[13:59.420 --> 14:02.420]  This is what I did.
[14:05.420 --> 14:08.420]  Go back a little bit.
[14:11.420 --> 14:14.420]  I'm going to go back a little bit.
[14:14.860 --> 14:17.860]  Okay.
[14:18.860 --> 14:21.860]  So an experiment is very general term.
[14:21.860 --> 14:24.860]  It's like something we do that predicts something.
[14:24.860 --> 14:27.860]  Remember I told you about the physics and the foundation of science?
[14:27.860 --> 14:30.860]  Well, you know what an experiment is.
[14:30.860 --> 14:37.860]  You set up some kind of process and then measure the outcome.
[14:39.860 --> 14:42.860]  In this case, an experiment would be something like...
[14:43.300 --> 14:46.300]  The options are...
[15:05.300 --> 15:08.300]  For it to be interesting, there's a few things that have to happen.
[15:08.300 --> 15:11.300]  There has to be more than one possible outcome.
[15:13.300 --> 15:16.300]  I'm not really talking about probability anymore.
[15:16.300 --> 15:19.300]  If you know exactly what's going to happen, probability is not equal.
[15:21.300 --> 15:24.300]  More than one possible outcome.
[15:27.300 --> 15:30.300]  What else is in my list here?
[15:31.300 --> 15:34.300]  A trial is one repetition of an experiment.
[15:34.300 --> 15:37.300]  There's one aspect.
[15:37.300 --> 15:40.300]  A trial is one repetition of an experiment.
[15:40.740 --> 15:43.740]  There's one aspect.
[15:46.740 --> 15:49.740]  Do that. It's fine.
[15:59.740 --> 16:02.740]  An experiment...
[16:02.740 --> 16:07.740]  You'll come back to trials and repetitions in the winter in BDS in 2075.
[16:08.180 --> 16:11.180]  When you learn about simulations.
[16:14.180 --> 16:17.180]  There is one aspect of a project.
[16:23.180 --> 16:28.180]  I can draw a card off the top of the deck.
[16:28.180 --> 16:31.180]  I can draw a card...
[16:32.180 --> 16:35.180]  I can shuffle the deck and I can do it again.
[16:35.620 --> 16:38.620]  Each time I shuffle the deck and draw a card off the deck is a trial.
[17:01.620 --> 17:04.620]  I shuffle...
[17:05.620 --> 17:08.620]  ...all the cards.
[17:19.620 --> 17:22.620]  For this, did you do all the cases?
[17:22.620 --> 17:25.620]  How many did you do?
[17:27.620 --> 17:30.620]  Probably just a fellow.
[17:30.620 --> 17:32.620]  Okay.
[17:32.620 --> 17:34.620]  Great.
[17:34.620 --> 17:38.620]  And then the event.
[17:38.620 --> 17:42.620]  The handle.
[17:42.620 --> 17:44.620]  What are you doing?
[17:44.620 --> 17:46.620]  Does it appear to have been there?
[17:46.620 --> 17:48.620]  You monkey-ass.
[17:48.620 --> 17:50.620]  Alright.
[17:50.620 --> 17:54.620]  You just need to spend a few minutes defining the words so that I can say them
[17:54.620 --> 17:58.620]  and then let everyone hopefully know what you're looking at.
[17:58.620 --> 18:00.620]  Okay.
[18:00.620 --> 18:02.620]  Fifteen.
[18:14.620 --> 18:18.620]  So you can draw the word over.
[18:18.620 --> 18:20.620]  Okay.
[18:20.620 --> 18:28.620]  And if you're talking about something that is like an indivisible event,
[18:28.620 --> 18:34.620]  like I can't draw anything simply, we call it elementary.
[18:42.620 --> 18:46.620]  Now some of these terms you're not going to hear as often as others.
[18:46.620 --> 18:50.620]  You don't hear people talking about elementary events very much.
[18:50.620 --> 18:54.620]  But that's what it's called when you are drawing like,
[18:54.620 --> 18:58.620]  when it's like the smallest event that is often.
[19:16.620 --> 19:20.620]  There are also aggregation events.
[19:20.620 --> 19:26.620]  Aggregation events would be something like drawing a.
[19:46.620 --> 19:48.620]  Okay.
[19:48.620 --> 19:54.620]  And four.
[20:02.620 --> 20:06.620]  So there are many cards that have aggregation problems in the deck.
[20:06.620 --> 20:10.620]  And so gist is known as aggregation.
[20:16.620 --> 20:20.620]  So many cards have aggregation problems.
[20:20.620 --> 20:24.620]  So many cards have or are aggregation problems.
[20:40.620 --> 20:46.620]  There's another important definition coming from more from theoretical
[20:46.620 --> 20:48.620]  probability.
[20:48.620 --> 20:52.620]  Talk about something called sample space.
[20:52.620 --> 21:02.620]  So the sample space is the set of all possible events.
[21:02.620 --> 21:06.620]  Probably say the set of all elementary.
[21:16.620 --> 21:28.620]  We often talk about the size of the sample space.
[21:28.620 --> 21:34.620]  Or the sets or the space itself.
[21:34.620 --> 21:38.620]  So let's go ahead and look at this.
[21:38.620 --> 21:44.620]  It is known as S.
[21:44.620 --> 21:48.620]  And it's usually written with set notation.
[21:48.620 --> 21:52.620]  Which hopefully you've run into before.
[21:52.620 --> 21:58.620]  For us it is all cards of bridge depth or depth.
[22:04.620 --> 22:08.620]  So let's go ahead and look at this.
[22:08.620 --> 22:24.620]  So the size of the sample space.
[22:24.620 --> 22:28.620]  You could write.
[22:28.620 --> 22:36.620]  I don't know if your text says this.
[22:36.620 --> 22:46.620]  I will use this.
[22:46.620 --> 22:50.620]  And it's either this.
[22:50.620 --> 22:54.620]  Or this.
[22:54.620 --> 22:58.620]  And it's either this.
[22:58.620 --> 23:02.620]  And it's either this.
[23:02.620 --> 23:06.620]  Or this.
[23:06.620 --> 23:10.620]  Okay.
[23:10.620 --> 23:20.620]  Are we okay so far with this blurry object?
[23:20.620 --> 23:30.620]  How do we know how it works?
[23:30.620 --> 23:40.620]  So let's go ahead and look at this.
[23:40.620 --> 23:48.620]  So let's go ahead and look at this.
[23:48.620 --> 23:58.620]  So interesting fact that I only learned about recently.
[23:58.620 --> 24:02.620]  So that probability and our understanding of chance.
[24:02.620 --> 24:06.620]  We really only in ten years ago.
[24:06.620 --> 24:10.620]  About 400 years ago.
[24:10.620 --> 24:18.620]  Before that we didn't have this language to talk about how language works.
[24:18.620 --> 24:24.620]  But people still played games of chance and things still happened randomly.
[24:24.620 --> 24:28.620]  So if you look at old, old books.
[24:28.620 --> 24:32.620]  People thought about chance as a handle.
[24:32.620 --> 24:34.620]  Like gods you can wreck.
[24:34.620 --> 24:38.620]  And you rolled an old dice.
[24:38.620 --> 24:44.620]  Whatever they came up with it was like god and a thing would come up that way.
[24:44.620 --> 24:46.620]  And people still gambled.
[24:46.620 --> 24:50.620]  They gambled assuming they were like under a million more gods.
[24:50.620 --> 24:52.620]  And that may still be the case.
[24:52.620 --> 25:02.620]  But now we have a language to describe probability.
[25:02.620 --> 25:12.620]  And the first real attempt at it was called classical probability.
[25:12.620 --> 25:28.620]  So we have to look at the rules and the complete understanding of the system.
[25:28.620 --> 25:36.620]  And the examples are,
[25:36.620 --> 25:40.620]  things that we can understand complete.
[25:40.620 --> 25:42.620]  Well, for the reason.
[25:42.620 --> 25:46.620]  Even like flipping a coin.
[25:46.620 --> 25:50.620]  We have done experiments and coins tend to not fall exactly 50-50.
[25:50.620 --> 25:54.620]  If they were like flipped by coin flipping machines.
[25:54.620 --> 26:00.620]  It's a very small bias to land the way they were already facing.
[26:00.620 --> 26:04.620]  Very small but it definitely is.
[26:04.620 --> 26:20.620]  You say that like pointless is 50-50.
[26:20.620 --> 26:26.620]  That is classical probability.
[26:26.620 --> 26:30.620]  But there is another type of probability that's really important.
[26:30.620 --> 26:34.620]  So the system is more complicated than the first dice.
[26:34.620 --> 26:42.620]  And that is called, I think they call it relative frequency in your text.
[26:42.620 --> 26:46.620]  I'm going to double-text.
[26:46.620 --> 26:56.620]  Relative frequency.
[26:56.620 --> 27:20.620]  Okay.
[27:20.620 --> 27:22.620]  Okay.
[27:22.620 --> 27:26.620]  And this is the type of probability that you rely on.
[27:26.620 --> 27:30.620]  In business and in science and many other things.
[27:30.620 --> 27:40.620]  Because the systems that you're studying are too complicated.
[27:40.620 --> 27:52.620]  And that's the most common view.
[27:52.620 --> 27:56.620]  So this is an example of where relative frequency kind of overrides classical frequencies.
[27:56.620 --> 27:58.620]  Okay.
[27:58.620 --> 28:26.620]  Okay.
[28:26.620 --> 28:54.620]  So if you want to achieve a tiny bit at coin flipping.
[28:54.620 --> 29:00.620]  The next time you do it, don't be the person that flips it.
[29:00.620 --> 29:02.620]  Oh, and if they catch it and then flip it again.
[29:02.620 --> 29:06.620]  You have to know something about the person flipping the coin.
[29:06.620 --> 29:10.620]  You have to know if they're going to catch it or catch it and flip it or drop it.
[29:10.620 --> 29:16.620]  And then you glance at what's based on it.
[29:16.620 --> 29:24.620]  You might have a tiny bit.
[29:24.620 --> 29:26.620]  Okay.
[29:26.620 --> 29:38.620]  So we will come back to relative frequency because we use it throughout business and science.
[29:38.620 --> 29:44.620]  We will do things like build frequency tables and then do more tests all the way from there.
[29:44.620 --> 29:50.620]  But for now, it's like you can know about it and we'll come back to it.
[29:50.620 --> 29:54.620]  You'll use classical probability for the rest of the class.
[29:54.620 --> 29:56.620]  We'll come back to it over to frequency.
[29:56.620 --> 29:58.620]  And then one more thing.
[29:58.620 --> 30:00.620]  What are they called?
[30:00.620 --> 30:02.620]  What are they called?
[30:30.620 --> 30:54.620]  Okay.
[30:54.620 --> 30:56.620]  Okay.
[30:56.620 --> 31:02.620]  So we do use subjective probability.
[31:02.620 --> 31:08.620]  It is useful when you don't have actual data to go on.
[31:08.620 --> 31:16.620]  And alarmingly, it is used by experts for some important decisions.
[31:16.620 --> 31:20.620]  Like should I take my company public for instance?
[31:20.620 --> 31:22.620]  Okay.
[31:22.620 --> 31:30.620]  So you don't know how well you're going to do.
[31:30.620 --> 31:36.620]  Major business decisions.
[31:36.620 --> 31:42.620]  Another interesting place of this effort is with sports.
[31:42.620 --> 31:54.620]  You might think that your favorite sports team has like a 60% chance of winning tonight because they won 60% of their games this week.
[31:54.620 --> 31:56.620]  But I'm not convinced that's true.
[31:56.620 --> 32:00.620]  I can't say like either are in a way to win or are not in a way to win.
[32:00.620 --> 32:04.620]  And we have no good way to describe that probability.
[32:04.620 --> 32:16.620]  I can kind of describe relative probability, but there's all the other factors that play.
[32:16.620 --> 32:20.620]  Most of sports fall under this.
[32:20.620 --> 32:30.620]  We try to apply relative frequency probability to sports gambling, but we're probably making some trouble.
[32:30.620 --> 32:38.620]  We should experience.
[32:38.620 --> 32:40.620]  All right.
[32:40.620 --> 32:48.620]  We're getting close to the middle of class.
[32:48.620 --> 32:52.620]  You know what we should do?
[33:22.620 --> 33:44.620]  Before we move on to kind of rules probability, we should talk a bit about how gambling cases get kind of complicated.
[33:44.620 --> 33:46.620]  Okay.
[34:14.620 --> 34:18.620]  All right.
[34:18.620 --> 34:22.620]  So sometimes it gets more complicated.
[34:22.620 --> 34:26.620]  For example, maybe we said try one card out of all the deck.
[34:26.620 --> 34:28.620]  We want to draw two cards.
[34:28.620 --> 34:32.620]  Each card is its own kind of deck.
[34:32.620 --> 34:46.620]  And the sample space of the experiment, which is that here, is all possible cards that we could draw in the board.
[35:02.620 --> 35:22.620]  Okay.
[35:22.620 --> 35:28.620]  So we'll have a break in a second.
[35:28.620 --> 35:40.620]  We'll start with a slightly tricky question for you to think about while we're on break.
[35:40.620 --> 35:48.620]  First I'm going to start writing out the sample space.
[35:48.620 --> 35:54.620]  So you could draw the eighth of spades and the eighth of hearts.
[35:54.620 --> 35:58.620]  You could draw the eighth of spades and then the eighth of diamonds.
[35:58.620 --> 36:02.620]  You could draw the eighth of spades and then the eighth of clubs.
[36:02.620 --> 36:08.620]  And then the eighth of spades, and that's considered different.
[36:08.620 --> 36:10.620]  And so on.
[36:10.620 --> 36:14.620]  This goes on for a very, very long time.
[36:14.620 --> 36:20.620]  Okay.
[36:20.620 --> 36:22.620]  I'm sure this will be fun.
[36:22.620 --> 36:24.620]  I'm going to call on the final question.
[36:24.620 --> 36:34.620]  Let's figure out the sample space.
[36:34.620 --> 36:46.620]  Okay.
[36:46.620 --> 36:48.620]  So we have 52 ways to draw a first card.
[36:48.620 --> 36:52.620]  So that first card can be the end of 52 cards.
[36:52.620 --> 36:54.620]  Then now the deck is down 51 cards.
[36:54.620 --> 36:56.620]  And 51 possible cards to draw.
[36:56.620 --> 36:58.620]  The order matters.
[36:58.620 --> 37:00.620]  I said so somewhere.
[37:00.620 --> 37:06.620]  The order matters, which is why I put that you could draw them in this order and then in that order.
[37:06.620 --> 37:08.620]  And those are different outcomes.
[37:08.620 --> 37:14.620]  And so the answer is 15, 52, and 51.
[37:14.620 --> 37:22.620]  I can't get very close to, but don't feel like I'm going to go out.
[37:22.620 --> 37:24.620]  I don't know how to draw it.
[37:24.620 --> 37:26.620]  I'm not the one on that.
[37:26.620 --> 37:28.620]  265.
[37:28.620 --> 37:38.620]  So there are 2652 different ways to draw a two-card.
[37:38.620 --> 37:40.620]  Okay.
[37:40.620 --> 37:48.620]  Okay.
[37:48.620 --> 37:54.620]  You're on my running space now.
[37:54.620 --> 37:56.620]  I'm just going to show you where else to get.
[37:56.620 --> 38:00.620]  There's an announcement here, one might think about the second tier support center.
[38:00.620 --> 38:08.620]  It is upstairs, LA 4092, right-of-the-way grab room on the floor.
[38:08.620 --> 38:10.620]  Up there.
[38:10.620 --> 38:14.620]  In-person hours, 4 to 7, Monday to Thursday.
[38:14.620 --> 38:18.620]  And in-person hours, 5 to 6, midterm and 1.
[38:18.620 --> 38:20.620]  Okay.
[38:20.620 --> 38:46.620]  Okay.
[38:46.620 --> 38:52.620]  So there's a math bug for you people.
[38:52.620 --> 38:56.620]  What they can be doing is practicing this course.
[38:56.620 --> 38:58.620]  So here's the text.
[38:58.620 --> 39:06.620]  Some people would benefit from reading the text, but I'm not sure that's a great use of all of your time.
[39:06.620 --> 39:14.620]  Instead, if you see something in class that you're like, oh, can I clarify?
[39:14.620 --> 39:16.620]  You have a couple options.
[39:16.620 --> 39:20.620]  One, you can practice from a few slides.
[39:20.620 --> 39:26.620]  I believe her slides are based on one of the professors who helped write the text.
[39:26.620 --> 39:28.620]  So the slides are just pretty useful.
[39:28.620 --> 39:40.620]  And you can also read any prior to the text in the course content here that you want to cover.
[39:40.620 --> 39:46.620]  So the first thing you want to do is practice problems because the whole class is really on calculation with rapid problems.
[39:46.620 --> 39:48.620]  We'll do practice problems in a couple questions.
[39:48.620 --> 39:56.620]  One, in the syllabus in general, there are some subjective problems.
[39:56.620 --> 40:04.620]  And in this list of subjective problems, you'll see a whole bunch of textbook problems from various groups.
[40:04.620 --> 40:06.620]  Where do you find them?
[40:06.620 --> 40:10.620]  Well, you get the text.
[40:10.620 --> 40:14.620]  And they are in one of two places.
[40:14.620 --> 40:24.620]  So if you want to text, let's say, go into chapter one.
[40:24.620 --> 40:32.620]  Either you can click through the arrow and get to different sections, but there's also video clear in table contents.
[40:32.620 --> 40:40.620]  And so at the end of those chapters, there are supplementary problems, which is where a lot of the problems are hiding.
[40:40.620 --> 40:46.620]  But in some chapters, when we go to the end of chapter supplementary problems, we start at problem one.
[40:46.620 --> 40:52.620]  In that case, I think chapter four is good.
[40:52.620 --> 40:58.620]  So looking to the end of chapter problems with chapter four, it starts at problem 35.
[40:58.620 --> 41:02.620]  So where are all the other practice problems?
[41:02.620 --> 41:06.620]  Well, they're hiding at the end of each section.
[41:06.620 --> 41:14.620]  So like after addition line, we're going to learn about today, some of the practice problems are here.
[41:14.620 --> 41:18.620]  Here's problem eight, nine, and so on.
[41:18.620 --> 41:22.620]  Some of these have answers written in text.
[41:22.620 --> 41:28.620]  Some of them have answers that are good problems.
[41:28.620 --> 41:38.620]  Okay, questions about practice problems and where they are hiding.
[41:38.620 --> 41:44.620]  Those are great problems that usually just have numerical or human-specific answer answers.
[41:44.620 --> 41:54.620]  The one downside of these problems is that they are a little different from what you'll see on the exam,
[41:54.620 --> 41:58.620]  because the exam has to be in multiple choice.
[41:58.620 --> 42:02.620]  So quizzes, we get to from here.
[42:02.620 --> 42:04.620]  There's quiz one.
[42:04.620 --> 42:06.620]  It's all multiple choice.
[42:06.620 --> 42:08.620]  We talked about that.
[42:08.620 --> 42:10.620]  So is, I am very fond of these quizzes.
[42:10.620 --> 42:12.620]  So here's the question.
[42:12.620 --> 42:14.620]  How many extra review and practice questions?
[42:14.620 --> 42:16.620]  They are also all multiple choice.
[42:16.620 --> 42:18.620]  They want to dislike X and Y.
[42:18.620 --> 42:20.620]  So at the bottom, we'll find more problems.
[42:20.620 --> 42:24.620]  And you click through all here.
[42:24.620 --> 42:30.620]  We have to get a bit of data, a math professor, to show us how many students have tried these questions,
[42:30.620 --> 42:34.620]  who's getting them wrong, conceivably who is struggling.
[42:34.620 --> 42:44.620]  So when you're writing exam questions, you can save some of these.
[42:44.620 --> 42:48.620]  But when you actually want to write a review for the exam, you can also do some of these for a week.
[42:48.620 --> 42:50.620]  So there's a whole bunch of different ways that you can practice.
[42:50.620 --> 42:56.620]  There's practice problems, there's problems with X, there's quizzes.
[42:56.620 --> 43:00.620]  Okay, that is the test.
[43:00.620 --> 43:02.620]  I'll put the name on top of this test.
[43:26.620 --> 43:28.620]  Okay.
[43:56.620 --> 44:06.620]  Okay.
[44:06.620 --> 44:12.620]  We need a couple more definitions before we move on to our calculations today.
[44:12.620 --> 44:18.620]  And for compliments, note the spelling.
[44:18.620 --> 44:34.620]  It has an E, not an I.
[44:34.620 --> 44:58.620]  So the compliment is essentially its opposite.
[44:58.620 --> 45:10.620]  Compliments are denoted A prime.
[45:10.620 --> 45:22.620]  So you can say the probability of A prime is E at 1 minus A prime.
[45:22.620 --> 45:36.620]  So, how do we do this?
[45:36.620 --> 45:58.620]  So we're going to be drawing space.
[45:58.620 --> 46:02.620]  So we're going to be using the very easy to assemble like that.
[46:02.620 --> 46:30.620]  We'll use that.
[46:30.620 --> 46:32.620]  Okay.
[47:00.620 --> 47:04.620]  Okay.
[47:04.620 --> 47:10.620]  Okay.
[47:10.620 --> 47:38.620]  Okay.
[47:38.620 --> 47:44.620]  So the definition of two events is those two events combined.
[47:44.620 --> 47:46.620]  We write it like this a little technically.
[47:46.620 --> 47:52.620]  The event that contains all of the columns in the event gave me.
[47:52.620 --> 48:04.620]  We write it like this.
[48:04.620 --> 48:08.620]  So we're going to be using the very easy to assemble like that.
[48:08.620 --> 48:10.620]  Okay.
[48:10.620 --> 48:12.620]  So that's A.
[48:12.620 --> 48:14.620]  And that's B.
[48:14.620 --> 48:16.620]  So A is the middle.
[48:16.620 --> 48:18.620]  That's A.
[48:18.620 --> 48:20.620]  A is drawing a case.
[48:20.620 --> 48:24.620]  B is drawing space.
[48:24.620 --> 48:30.620]  Then remember that question I asked at the beginning of class.
[48:30.620 --> 48:32.620]  So A is drawing space.
[48:32.620 --> 48:50.620]  Then A union B is drawing a case for.
[48:50.620 --> 48:54.620]  So that's probably introduced the concept of Vanna diagrams for problem
[49:20.620 --> 49:30.620]  solving.
[49:30.620 --> 49:58.620]  So if this box represents the sample shape.

[49:58.620 --> 50:10.620]  And event A is some area in the class.
[50:10.620 --> 50:12.620]  Okay.
[50:12.620 --> 50:24.620]  Then the complement of A is everything else.
[50:24.620 --> 50:30.620]  We call it A prime.
[50:30.620 --> 50:36.620]  That is how you diagram a complement.
[50:36.620 --> 50:44.620]  A is one part of the sample space and A prime is everything else.
[50:44.620 --> 51:00.620]  I guess with all the hatches clear I thought.
[51:00.620 --> 51:10.620]  So we're going to go back.
[51:10.620 --> 51:14.620]  Maybe I'll go from there.
[51:14.620 --> 51:38.620]  So think about line.
[51:38.620 --> 51:44.620]  So that's A.
[51:44.620 --> 51:48.620]  Then the sample space.
[51:48.620 --> 51:58.620]  You can draw an A.
[51:58.620 --> 52:00.620]  Which is here.
[52:00.620 --> 52:02.620]  So that's A.
[52:02.620 --> 52:12.620]  Which shall make bigger circles.
[52:12.620 --> 52:18.620]  And they overlap.
[52:18.620 --> 52:22.620]  So the union of B is everything.
[52:22.620 --> 52:38.620]  That is covered by.
[52:38.620 --> 52:40.620]  So that's A.
[52:40.620 --> 53:04.620]  So that's A.
[53:04.620 --> 53:22.620]  So that's A.
[53:22.620 --> 53:32.620]  The other important and simple concept is these combining probabilities.
[53:32.620 --> 53:56.620]  So let's go back.
[54:26.620 --> 54:30.620]  So this is the best example of the spokes move.
[54:30.620 --> 54:32.620]  It is in the diagram.
[54:32.620 --> 54:36.620]  It is that little slot right in the middle.
[54:36.620 --> 54:42.620]  We write in.
[54:42.620 --> 54:46.620]  I'm not 100% sure why they just put the U upside down.
[54:46.620 --> 54:48.620]  Anything would confuse them.
[54:48.620 --> 54:50.620]  Maybe it could get on or something.
[54:50.620 --> 54:52.620]  So that's A.
[54:52.620 --> 54:58.620]  It's an upside down U.
[54:58.620 --> 55:06.620]  And then the diagram.
[55:06.620 --> 55:08.620]  Let's use all the main colors here.
[55:08.620 --> 55:10.620]  And then we have to set up the same way.
[55:10.620 --> 55:12.620]  That is A.
[55:12.620 --> 55:18.620]  This is A.
[55:18.620 --> 55:22.620]  And intersection of the two.
[55:22.620 --> 55:34.620]  Is what the diagram is set.
[55:34.620 --> 55:42.620]  And the difference between intersection and union is A4 versus M.
[55:42.620 --> 55:48.620]  This is an A10.
[55:48.620 --> 55:52.620]  So that's A.
[55:52.620 --> 55:54.620]  Kids.
[55:54.620 --> 55:56.620]  So that's A.
[55:56.620 --> 56:24.620]  So that's A.
[56:24.620 --> 56:26.620]  Okay.
[56:26.620 --> 56:28.620]  So that's A.
[56:28.620 --> 56:32.620]  Any questions about the difference between these two?
[56:32.620 --> 56:42.620]  Sometime soon, maybe at the end of the class, or likely next class,
[56:42.620 --> 56:46.620]  we will learn how to make calculations between these two.
[56:46.620 --> 56:48.620]  There are formulas for that.
[56:48.620 --> 56:50.620]  Until then.
[56:50.620 --> 56:58.620]  We have a couple more definitions to talk about.
[56:58.620 --> 57:12.620]  Maybe you have heard of mutually exclusive equations.
[57:12.620 --> 57:24.620]  Using our language today.
[57:24.620 --> 57:48.620]  So, the mutually exclusive event is an event or two events that do not intersect.
[57:48.620 --> 57:52.620]  So, these two are not hard to think of.
[57:52.620 --> 58:04.620]  Just any of the things that can't go past it, and the cards that can't go.
[58:04.620 --> 58:14.620]  So, one card can be both.
[58:14.620 --> 58:28.620]  Those two events are mutually exclusive.
[58:28.620 --> 58:34.620]  So, the card can go and pay and also be hard.
[58:34.620 --> 58:38.620]  They are mutually exclusive.
[58:38.620 --> 58:56.620]  Another way to think about this is if one happens, the other can't.
[58:56.620 --> 58:58.620]  And I mean like this card.
[58:58.620 --> 59:04.620]  So, if you draw a card and it turns out to be a same, you can't magically spend your heart on it.
[59:04.620 --> 59:16.620]  That's a mutually exclusive event.
[59:16.620 --> 59:20.620]  So, again, relaxing before we get to calculations.
[59:50.620 --> 01:00:12.620]  So, let's go ahead and start.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:34.620]  So, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of others.
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:01:02.620]  So, the results across five events are independent.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:12.620]  So, the probability of others is not the same.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:22.620]  So, the probability of others is not the same.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:32.620]  So, in the case of the first event, I can't say anything about whether others draw.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.620]  In classical probability, the answer is no.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:38.620]  You want to make sure it's properly.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.620]  It will not change.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:50.620]  I draw the easy space.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:56.940]  And then I draw a second.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.940]  So then I shuffle again and start a new trial.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.080]  And I draw a new card.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:30.220]  Drawing any card now is independent of the first test.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:46.540]  Real life example that you are at risk of coming to.
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:55.940]  I know that after I had told him this in previous lessons, he didn't come up to me and say, no, go ahead.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.940]  Come on, really.
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.940]  Roulette.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:08.940]  Every outcome, every time you spin the roulette wheel, the ball ends on a number.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:12.340]  Red, black, blue, red, whatever number it ends on.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.140]  That is one trial.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:22.140]  And then every time someone spins the roulette wheel, it's a different trial and so on.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.140]  And then the mystery is born.
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.140]  Five, six, seven, black, and rose.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:31.140]  But each trial is independent.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:43.140]  And then the roulette wheel is an independent trial.
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:04:07.140]  In five or six blocks here in a row, some people are like, well, black is on a pair.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:15.140]  And then on a black, some people think that, oh, black has had its due and now it's time for the world to come back to balance.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.140]  And spin a red.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.140]  Neither is true.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:33.140]  Either the three are likely to continue or a red more likely to appear.
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:46.140]  The leaf otherwise had a formal name.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.140]  It is known as the gambler's bat.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:26.140]  And I know that much money has been lost.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:29.140]  The opposite of independence is dependent.
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:47.140]  If you're at the casino with your friends and someone's playing roulette and then they say something on the line, I am due, you tell them to separate.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:42.140]  I am going to give you a minute to admit it.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:47.140]  The events are events that do the same thing.
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:07:09.140]  And unlike drawing one card and then shuffling and then drawing a new first card, if you draw one card and then draw a second card, the event of drawing the first card affects the effect of drawing the second card.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:34.140]  If the first card is ace, the second card is now less likely to be an ace because there are less aces in the deck.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:46.140]  That is what a dependent event is, where the actual event can be shown to affect some other event.
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:55.140]  There is a mistaken belief that roulette will work this way, that if the full pick-lacks are rolled, that it is more likely to be a common red or black.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.140]  Neither is true.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:03.140]  The card is true because what we say is that it affects the composition of the event.
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:11.140]  The interesting thing is that this is a principle of artifact.
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:23.140]  That you actually can, in the right conditions, have slowly, with a lot of risk, but slowly make money playing black.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.140]  Thank you.

[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  And the thing is that you are coming to me to solve your question. This is not right.
[00:05.000 --> 00:10.000]  If you have a question regarding the law, ask the other person.
[00:10.000 --> 00:15.000]  If you have a question regarding the political power, don't ask him. Ask me.
[00:15.000 --> 00:19.000]  If you have questions of resurrection, ask me.
[00:19.000 --> 00:25.000]  You are welcome to come to my office. Just like an appointment with me.
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  Usually Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, I am free.
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  But this Monday I am going to go to the doctor.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  But in general, I am free Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays.
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  Tuesdays and Sundays I teach them seven.
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.000]  Maybe you can come to my office at seven. But let me know.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  If I am still alive, let me know. I can answer your questions.
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  Okay, questions.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  Okay, so what is this logic is?
[01:00.000 --> 01:08.000]  Although we talked about it before, but now I find to go through it in details.
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  This is the simple for inverter.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  Inverter means I got one, I get zero.
[01:18.000 --> 01:25.000]  When the input is zero, the output is one.
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  We are working with the symbols.
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  These are different symbols for inverter.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  The input is low, the output is high.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  When the input is high, the output is low.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  This is the signal.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  High, the output is low.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  This is the symbol for inverter.
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  Input high, output low, low, output high.
[02:10.000 --> 02:17.000]  In Boolean expression, we will have a bar.
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  Input e, then the output is a bar.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  We have seen what is the once component.
[02:29.000 --> 02:37.000]  And we can use eight inverters to implement the circuit for the once component.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  One, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, one.
[02:41.000 --> 02:51.000]  The output is zero, zero, one, zero, one, one, one, zero.
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  I may ask you a question like this in the final exam, a simple question.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  So I will give you the input and I will ask you to select one of the four outputs.
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  One of them will be this number and there will be another three wrong answers.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  So this kind of question is very easy.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  So don't amass with these easy questions.
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  Make sure to get the full credit.
[03:19.000 --> 03:26.000]  So spend a few seconds, extra few seconds, to make sure that your answer is correct.
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  Many times I ask students in the final exam these easy questions
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  and sometimes I find students do mistakes.
[03:36.000 --> 03:43.000]  For example, if you want the answer zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, one, zero,
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  then the answer is wrong.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  When the answer is wrong, then this answer.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  If the question was the two's component, what is the two's component?
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  You get the once component and then what you do?
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  You add one, you add one.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  So if you add one, then this will become one and the rest are the same.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  Many times I ask questions, what is the two's component of this solution?
[04:11.000 --> 04:18.000]  And of course, like I will find 95% of the students' answer is correct,
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  but few students will answer the question wrong for whatever reason.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  I don't know because this is a very simple, easy question.
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.000]  Okay?
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  So make sure, and once, one really weird case,
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  the student answers this question wrong and answers all the other questions,
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  the difficult questions, correct, correct, correct, correct.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  One question wrong, which is the easiest question in the exam,
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  and of course the student ends up with a buzz,
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  but I want to meet with this student to see what was wrong,
[04:50.000 --> 04:56.000]  why he didn't answer the easy question and answer the harder questions.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  He reminds me when I was young, I was in the same state,
[05:00.000 --> 05:10.000]  and the gate, we talked about inverter, now the second gate is, and the gate.
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  One, one, what is the output?
[05:12.000 --> 05:13.000]  One.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  One, zero, what is the output?
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.000]  Zero.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  Zero, one, what is the output?
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.000]  Zero.
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  Zero, zero, what is the output?
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.000]  Zero.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000]  Zero.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  When I say zero or one, it is the same as saying low, low, what is the output?
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.000]  Low.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  High, low, what is the output?
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  Low.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  Only when both the inputs are high, the output is,
[05:34.000 --> 05:42.000]  we went through this in the first week, first chapter.
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  True stable.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  True stable will solve a lot of problems for us.
[05:48.000 --> 05:55.000]  This is a true stable, zero, zero, or zero multiplied by zero is zero.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  One multiplied by zero is zero.
[05:57.000 --> 05:59.000]  Zero multiplied by one is zero.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  One multiplied by one is one.
[06:01.000 --> 06:08.000]  And when I say multiplied by, it's correct, but I'm talking about Boolean algebra.
[06:08.000 --> 06:13.000]  In the Boolean algebra, one times one equal one.
[06:13.000 --> 06:20.000]  In the Boolean algebra, one plus one equal one.
[06:20.000 --> 06:24.000]  Because it is true or true.
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  Equal one.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  High or high equals high.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  We'll come to this soon.
[06:31.000 --> 06:40.000]  If I have three inputs, it will be only one if all of them, one plus one, otherwise it is zero.
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  Still, we still end the gate.
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  This is end the gate.
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.000]  Timing diagram means one times one or one and one.
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  What is the output?
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  One.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  Zero and one. What is the output?
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  Zero.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  Right?
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  One and one. What is the output?
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.000]  One.
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  One and zero. What is the output?
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.000]  Zero.
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  Zero and zero. What is the output?
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  Zero.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  Questions?
[07:18.000 --> 07:28.000]  So if I give you the final exam or middle exam, the input and four possible outputs.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  So you'll select this one. You'll select the one which is correct.
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  There's only one correct and I will confuse you by giving some wrong answers.
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  I will go zero, zero, one, zero, zero, zero.
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  If I go zero here, it's not correct.
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  If I go one, one, one, zero, zero, it's not correct.
[07:49.000 --> 07:58.000]  So in your case, in the past, I gave two inputs and I asked students to sketch the waveform for the output.
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  But in your case, all questions will be marked with shorts.
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  Okay? So you will select one answer out of five answers.
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  Questions?
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  Now I have a question.
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  Suppose that I give you A and X.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  Can I ask you what is B?
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  Yes? Right?
[08:27.000 --> 08:37.000]  But if I ask you what is B and you begin to sketch B, why the answer will give me a hard time?
[08:37.000 --> 08:38.000]  Yes?
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  For T2, it can be zero instead of a one and it will still give you a zero.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  Thank you very much. You'll get to it.
[08:45.000 --> 08:53.000]  So quickly she said, oh, here, this, the answer, you see, what you want to call the answer.
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  The answer is one.
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  And there is another answer for B, zero.
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  And still the output is zero.
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.000]  Then if I give you the question and if it was not part of the choice, this is zero.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  This one is correct.
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  Then I will have problems marking the question because there will be more than one answer.
[09:16.000 --> 09:24.000]  But if I give you this input and I give you this output and you select one of the possible B,
[09:24.000 --> 09:35.000]  I will make sure that I will give you only one correctly to select one out of four.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  So again, is this a possible question in the midterm exam or a final exam?
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  Yes?
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.000]  And the last one, I give this question, few students did mistake.
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  Most of the students answered the question.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  Okay, because it is a second question.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  The same different questions, different waveforms.
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  When one one, the output is one.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  Otherwise, zero.
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  When zero, we get zero, zero, one, zero.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, the output is zero.
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  Questions?
[10:16.000 --> 10:25.000]  Here, during this middle period, one, zero, then what is the output?
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  Zero.
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  One one, what is the output?
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  One.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  So you can see the question is simple.
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.000]  Again, I'm telling you when I taught this course 100 years ago, it was easy.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  Of course, this material is the same.
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  The basics is the same.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  We didn't change the basics.
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  The mass is the same.
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  Current is the same.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  Voltage is the same.
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  Electrical circuit is the same.
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  But when we go to other courses, all the materials will change.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  The micro-recess will change.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  A lot of things will change.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  If I have three inputs, it will get one when all of them are.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  Otherwise, it is zero.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  So this is with three inputs.
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.000]  The same rules, the same idea.
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  I can give you three inputs and select one of the possible outputs.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  All right?
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  This is important.
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  Now, here we will begin to talk about Boolean expression.
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  If input is A, B, what is the output?
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  A, B.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  A, B is the output.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  A multiplied by B.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  Boolean expression.
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  A, B, C is a Boolean expression.
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  Table.
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  Zero multiplied by zero is zero.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  Zero and zero is zero.
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.000]  Zero one is zero.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  One zero zero.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  One one is one.
[12:15.000 --> 12:22.000]  I can add this big box, one millisecond, with another boxes here.
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  And the output will be looked like that.
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  We are going to talk about counters and registers in the night.
[12:34.000 --> 12:48.000]  I can build useful circuits using just the end gate.
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  If you turn the car on, then there is one here.
[12:54.000 --> 13:06.000]  And if you don't hold the seat belt, then one here.
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.000]  So one and one and one for 50 seconds will give one here.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  And then it will be beep beep beep beep beep.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  Why? Because the output is one.
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  What I want to show you here is a simple circuit.
[13:20.000 --> 13:32.000]  We will use one here to make the alarm on when you start the car and you don't put the seat belt.
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  But if you put the seat belt, then you will have zero here.
[13:36.000 --> 13:44.000]  Then this zero will end up in the bottom and you will use zero and no alarm.
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  So at the end, I have here one or zero.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  I will have one means alarm.
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  One means you didn't put the seat belt.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  You didn't put the seat belt and you started the car.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  You don't want to be here just beep forever.
[14:07.000 --> 14:14.000]  So one here means we will use one here for 30 seconds.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  After 30 seconds, the alarm will go off.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  You can of course design whatever circuit you want.
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.000]  As long as you want to have one here, then this is one, one, one.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  Then there is one here.
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  The surface is one, one, zero, and then zero.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  One, zero, one, then there is zero here.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  You didn't start the car.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  Zero, one, one, there is zero here.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  Then there is no alarm because you didn't start the car.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  You can build useful circuits using very simple gates.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  I believe you will do this also in the moment.
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  20 years ago or more, the project was to design calculators.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  We changed it to design calculators.
[15:04.000 --> 15:11.000]  There are several projects with a lot of advisors that you can select from.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  Now I'm going to move to all gates.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  We talked about inverter.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  We talked about no gate.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  Now this is all gates.
[15:23.000 --> 15:43.000]  When I say Boolean expression, Boolean expression means I have something like X equals A, B plus say C.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  This is a Boolean expression.
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  So you didn't see what I was doing in Wisconsin.
[15:59.000 --> 16:08.000]  So Boolean expression, if I have X equals one plus one, equals one.
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  Why? Because this is one or one.
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  Hard or high is high.
[16:15.000 --> 16:19.000]  Believe me, some students in the final exam, they wrote two.
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  We don't have to do it by the way.
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  We don't have to.
[16:24.000 --> 16:32.000]  One plus one, if I'm doing mathematical operations, then one plus one equals zero and I have a carry one.
[16:32.000 --> 16:38.000]  But when I'm doing Boolean algebra, this is one or one.
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  This is true or true.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  True or true equals? True.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  One plus one equals one.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  We'll come to this soon.
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  This is the all gate.
[16:55.000 --> 17:00.000]  This is the symbol that we are going to use.
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.000]  Low plus low equals low.
[17:03.000 --> 17:06.000]  Low or low equals low.
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.000]  High or low equals high. Low or high equals high. High or high equals high.
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  In a table, this is a truth table.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  Zero plus zero equals zero.
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  Zero, one, equals one.
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.000]  One, zero, that is one.
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  One plus one, one.
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  True or true equals true.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  So this is Boolean algebra.
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  Can I have a wave? Yes?
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  Timing diagram here. One, one.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  What is the output?
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  Zero, one. What is the output? One.
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  Zero, zero. What is the output? Zero.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  One, zero. What is the output? One.
[17:52.000 --> 17:58.000]  Again, can I give you X and A and ask for B? Yes.
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  But I may end up with a few answers, which is fine.
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  No problem.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  So if I have zero, zero, zero is zero.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  Otherwise, I will have one because one of them is one or both of them is one.
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  So one, zero, one, zero.
[18:24.000 --> 18:30.000]  So this is the output for these two inputs.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  More examples.
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  More examples with three inputs.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  So only the output will be zero if all of them equals zero.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  Result here, zero. Yes.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  Bring this period.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  Here one.
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.000]  Here zero. Zero, zero, zero.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  This output is zero.
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  So these kind of questions you do it carefully and you get four marks in here.
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.000]  This is very easy questions.
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.000]  In terms of Boolean expression, X equals A plus B.
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  X equals A plus B plus C. X equals A plus B plus C plus B.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  This is the Boolean expression.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  For the output.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  Table. Zero plus zero, zero.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  Zero plus one is one.
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  One plus zero is one. One plus one is one.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  Again, this is Boolean algebra.
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  It's not mathematical operation. It's Boolean algebra.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  Now we have a system here.
[19:41.000 --> 19:50.000]  And here also to show you that I can build a useful system using just one gate or gate.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  What is this system?
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.000]  I have another window and the door.
[19:57.000 --> 20:02.000]  And I want to make sure that they are all then closed.
[20:02.000 --> 20:11.000]  So the sensor are magnetic switches that produce a high output when one is open.
[20:11.000 --> 20:15.000]  So if this window is open, this is the high window.
[20:15.000 --> 20:19.000]  If this window is open, window number two, then I have a high window.
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.000]  If the door is open, I have a high window.
[20:22.000 --> 20:29.000]  But if this is closed, this is closed, this is closed, then I have zero, zero, zero, then no alarm.
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  Zero, zero, zero means safe.
[20:33.000 --> 20:38.000]  Two windows are closed and the door is closed.
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  So zero here, then no alarm.
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  But if any one of them is open, or all of them is open, or two of them is open,
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.000]  then I have one here and there will be alarm.
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  Telling me that you should close the window.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  Or the door.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  Because this doesn't tell you if the door is open or the window is open.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  It tells you there's a problem.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  One of them is open.
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  Or closed.
[21:09.000 --> 21:14.000]  So this is telling you that with just one more gate I can design a very useful circuit.
[21:14.000 --> 21:20.000]  By the end of the course you will be able to do very useful designs using some integrated circuit,
[21:20.000 --> 21:32.000]  connect them together, then you can do something like piano to select certain frequencies and send it to the speaker.
[21:32.000 --> 21:39.000]  So you will be able to do some useful circuits after the end of the course.
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  Now we move to a universal gate.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  I talked about and gate or gate, not gate, right?
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  But this one is universal.
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  It's called NAND gate.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  And why it has this special name?
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  Because it's a universal gate.
[21:57.000 --> 22:04.000]  Because I can use it to build not gate, or AND gate, or all gates.
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  So I can build any gate.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  So I can build the whole expression.
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  So I can build the whole circuit using only NAND gates.
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  So what is this NAND gate?
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.000]  NAND gate is N followed by inverter.
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  Followed by inverter.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  Okay.
[22:32.000 --> 22:41.000]  So I have here NAND gate.
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.000]  This is X and this is Y.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  Before the inverter I have XY.
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.000]  After the circuit I have XY bar.
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  Okay.
[22:56.000 --> 23:06.000]  So if I have here XY, XY, XY bar, 0, 0.
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  What is XY?
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  0.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  What is XY bar?
[23:11.000 --> 23:12.000]  1.
[23:12.000 --> 23:13.000]  1, 0.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  What is the output?
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  0.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  What is XY bar?
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  1.
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  What is the output?
[23:23.000 --> 23:24.000]  0.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  What is the output?
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  1.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  1, 1.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  What is the output?
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  What is here?
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  0.
[23:34.000 --> 23:45.000]  I want you to see here that if I calculate Y bar, then it's for UR1, 0, 0.
[23:45.000 --> 23:52.000]  If I calculate X bar, then this is 1, 0, 1, 0.
[23:52.000 --> 23:57.000]  If I calculate X bar plus Y bar, then Y bar plus X bar.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  What is 1 plus 1?
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  1 plus 1 is?
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.000]  1.
