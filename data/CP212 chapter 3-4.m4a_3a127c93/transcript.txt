 This is the end of chapter 3, chapter 2. And about more to the chapter 3, we started with how to open, or how to insert all these, how to write a video code inside. But not exactly just introduction. And then I only left three slides there for this chapter, and now we'll move to chapter 4 for how to record micro or micro. So IntelliSense, IntelliSense which is available for pretty much every language, so you know. Right, and here if you click, if you do a lot of things, they save you time. I'm going to do on the left side. So we start with using the left side. And then developer, that's the first sentence you need to put in your insert to your Excel. And now once you insert your Avidar ribbon, it will be there, right? So IntelliSense, and you can see all the colors. IntelliSense refers to give you errors and help you write a little bit. Only one or two words, and then it will give you some hint, like for some keyword. If you type an integer, for example now we need to define a variable, like an integer, like a single or double. If you just write in, then it will write away and lead to, like here, define JS integer. So if I just write in, then it will show integer on the right side. Then it will directly make it quickly. And also the color you can see here. And also if you just type this out, then it will give you, and for writing code here now, let's see, if I write a new sign, let's just write a new sign. Sub. So Sub, Sub team, when you write your code, always start with Sub. Then you need to have your name. Let's say pest. Then you need a parenthesis. And then it will automatically give you an end sub. You just use space and it will give you that. And inside it will deem, deem, like deem M as, as you see. Whenever you use space, whenever you see here, as space, I'm touching space, then it will show properties and message. You don't need, like if you type one word, one character, it will automatically give you that. You can just click. So now I'm just doing integers, so I, surely everywhere. Then end, you see here integer. Then you just right click on the space, then it will begin. You don't need to type lot. But also if you do the dot, if you say range, if I express range, let's say if I'm doing range, see, I'm doing range. Then if you don't know what to do, you see here, you just type range. Then you click here, range. You just directly showing range message. How do you do, right? You say sales, right? It shows you sales, one sales, two sales, right? And so on. Also, for example, I can just write range, let's say, because right inside it, you need to have these quotes, double quotes. Let's say in one, so I'm pointing out in one sale, then if you just use dot, then it will choose dot. Whenever you use dot, it will choose the message. Like you want to, like, doing like a font, if I write font, write at all. And these are all the message. And all can read. You see here, if I put a key in and delete there, and just move here, space, and so on. And also, like, if I want to type a message box, often showing you the results, what is that, right? Message box, starting with M-S-G, M-S-G as message box, B-G-O-S. Then you do the space, see here, space. So it will give you the message there. A lot of things, you see, you have to memorize, but we don't know how to memorize a lot of things like that, right? So you see there, you know where you put, where you should put. That's in the case you don't know, right? So that's what refers these in palaces. Next, color. Case and color. Case, in case V-B-N-E is case insensitive. But keyword always start. Keyword means, like, pivot table. These are keywords, like, it's reserved there, you cannot touch, right? And they have the first letter as capital, that's where you see all keywords start with capital letter. Make four loops, you want to start with four. J is equal to one, then to five, and so on, and next, right? So your next would be reserved there, and with capital N, okay? But in general, your names would be just okay, just case insensitive. So that really means if you use capital words and non-capital words, they are the same. But, however, it's always give you only one. Like, if you start with, like, start, like, if I start here, J, you see here, J. D, the first one, D, J as integer. And that J is lower case. If you start, first one is lower case, then the rest one, if you even write upper case, it will directly show you the lower case. But, however, if you just use, so that's for single word. But, however, often when you have your meaningful names, meaningful names, like you don't want to make, like, sine theta, right? I want value sine theta. So what variable do you want to use? You would probably use SIN, right? But SIN is reserved by them, so you don't want to use SIN, right? And, because that's a function, right? That's a function reserved. So I would use SINQ. I use capital S here. And often the reason why I use capital, that's what I always like to do. The first one, capital order. If your words with two words, I would use either if your word use two words, make some cost as one word, like total of your cost, right? And you put it there, that's your name. And then the name here, you put a C here, C-O-S-T, C there. So, next time whenever you write something wrong, you write a capital. So, whatever you check, it's easy to check, because whenever you change something, it doesn't change, and then you know something wrong. That's what I do. So I always put a capital either in S or in C. And so if you have a long name, you want to use one capital there, so next time whenever you write, it's easy to detect if you lose. If you're missing one word, one letter, right? Because very often you don't want to miss if you use a sound. If you suddenly write wrong, like S, you write as T. And so, but anyway, that's my experience. I like to use one capital word at the beginning or in the middle of that to show the difference, to see. Because this is a larger word, you can see easily your variable. And so, so comments, comments are green, and all the keywords are blue as you can see here. And I comment here, apostrophe, starting with apostrophe here, then you see the keyword. And by your code or variable, they're all black, right? All black. But if you do something wrong there, it will remind you. So it will show you that. For example, if I just write for something J, I missed equal. Then it will tell you. If I missed equal, it will tell you, you missed equal sign. And for example here, if I just delete, see here, it will say compile error, expect equal. Right, so you know. So that's something here. If you have a syntax error, it will remind you. So it's not too bad. So finally, all of these, if you want to know your open to work book, it always goes to here. And that's VBA project. VBA projects. And that's from here. From here, this is simple. Always choose what do you have. And you see here you have these, you have these. That's the solver, that's I have here inside. And that's this workbook, this workbook. And I have these. And if you have forms in the future, user forms, you know what you'll hear. And if you have charge, and you will hear. So you see here you have worksheets. In worksheets also you could have charts. So if you ever have charts, it will show you here. So everything, everything will, if you want to see everything, then it's here. And if you want to change your module name, and module name is here, modules means your video code, your subroutines, I mean your sound mode. Actually if you want to put a module inside, you can put several or many subroutines there. But your module is your module, it's your, I mean, kind of big sense. Then you inside put all the subroutines to finish the work. And so the module you just click on here. And then you click on the profile window. The name belongs to 40. So that's for the profile window. So for example, I want to change, if I want to change it on the left side now, I want to change the name. Did you see here? I can close them. I close them, then it's gone. But now I highlight the sign for sign means, I highlight this. And you can use these, you see here, profile windows to shoot. Then names I can say, okay, test, underscore test. And that's it. You see here, underscore test is shooting here. So you can change whatever name you like. Because if you're silent and I will ask you to change your module name, so you will need to change your module name for different, according to what I asked in your first assignment. I will announce it soon, a couple of days today or tomorrow. Okay. And then that's all for this. For the chapter. For the chapter three. Oh, no. No, I couldn't close. What should I do? I might share. I'll do it here. I'll do it here. See if I can do. Okay, now I can do here. So that's the chapter three. Now I want to go to here. Now since I'm done with this, I'm going to show you. Show the scene. You know what? I can do this. I can do this. Okay. So now, it's about the chapter. Let's move to the recording module. Then we can get started to the real write code there. So what is module? The module is just to do repetitive work. Right. And a module, I know we say a module, it refers to a piece of code inside of your VBA editor. So whenever you record the module, you record the sequence. Then actually they write the code on the page. So we don't need to write, so we say, without coding. So we don't need to do code, but they do by themselves. And so, module can do this easy work, but it cannot do the loops. It cannot do the controls and a lot of advanced database operations. And they cannot do on time collaborations, means they cannot do input or output. Because it's just you do from step one, then you do finally, and then you stop. And you cannot do anything, interact with them. So module cannot do a lot of things. So what we want to do, first, we will work with spreadsheet. Then we're doing that. So spreadsheet, for the spreadsheet, let's say, Oh, okay, I'm going to use my, I'm going to show my spreadsheet. So spreadsheet, when you see here, I have the same, even on my menu space, I have these two files uploaded there. But you see the same names, but different extension. So one is Excel, the other is micro-enabled. You have M, so this one, you don't have the micro-enabled. So let me first show you here. Now back into the, what I want to do here is, not yet, but here. Let me see here. So graph, assign, and assign function, and staff. So what I write here is, what I want to do, what we want to do is, first, if you want to do macro, first you need data, right? So now I just want to import sine curves. So you need data's angles, 0 to 360 degree, right? So first you import your angles in the column A. Then you need to write equations, I mean functions, and to calculate what is your sine theta, what is cosine theta, right? And then we can do the functions. So let's first view your data. So now enter formula. This is enter formula. We need to do how to enter our formula here. And how to do copy and paste, how to do auto-fill of this net creation chart. The copy and paste spatial values, probably you already know this, and the sorting and format sales. What else you can do? Of course, you have more than this. These are the main things you can do, and for the spreadsheet. So opening cell, whenever you open cell, now if I just open a new, this is a new Excel. So this is a new Excel. Then it always issues this one by default. You can change its name. Then what is its address? And how do it refers to each here? So we use this here, rows, 1 to many, and A, B, C, D to many. So we use A1 refers to this one, B1 refers to this one, L, and so on. So we start with character A, B, C, D, and then we use the number to express the position. Then now, for here, for the address, now as you can see here, and if you want to use a range, A1 is here, but if you want a range, and you just annoying D2 and to D3, that's a range here, right? And when you use range, you use here. You use the signs here. And now, next. As you can see here, this is a sale address. As you already know, it use rows. The column use the letters to represent them. And this is the range. Now how do you enter your formula? Formula bar is here. And also, sale name is here. Whenever you highlight which of everywhere you choose here, that's your sale address. Formula bar. Formula bar always start with equal. Equal to what? And this is worksheet. And you just worksheet. And on the right side, worksheet name, you can always change to whatever you like. Just rename. See here, rename to asset sheet. Or you can use test. And this plus sign always means insert. So just insert. If you want to insert a chart, it always can insert a chart. See here, insert a chart. So it can, and you just delete. Just delete. See here, right click, key. So if you highlight whatever you want to operate with whenever you just highlight them, then right mouse, then you see all of these. And so now let's go back to the left. So sales address. Sales address, we have relative or absolute. You have two things. Like A2, A1, this is relative. And absolute refers to constant. And you see here, relative means whether you copy sales or you will copy relatively regarding that sales. And so let's say absolute reference refers to constant. If you want to use that variable in that sale, you don't want to change. You want to keep that as constant. You need to add the dollar sign. And that's for absolute reference. Now formula. Now formula bar is this bar, right? This one is showing whichever highlights, right? I want to highlight this. So now I have two, three. Now I want to do what? I want to add these two, three to equal than that. So it will show the formula you use. Now you can copy and paste. You just copy these two past here. You don't need to redo everything, right? You can copy past or you can just drag to draw. Let me just show you here. This one on the right side. See? That's equal. Then if I just click this. Now I wanted to operate this. You can just copy and paste. So paste. Now because it's relative, so it will change in this position. It will add this, this. So now I change it to the nine from eight, right? And one way you can copy and just use copy. The other way you can do it, you use plus. You place your mouse. Place the mouse to the bottom right corner, like this corner. Now I'm going to show you a plus sign. Then you just drag. And so that's how you copy here all the time. Copy and paste automatically. Now let's back to the left. Back to the left. Now showing you what is the absolute reference. You need to use dollar sign. Right now you have A8, A8. You don't have dollar sign. Next you need a dollar sign to show that number doesn't change the next time you do something. But how to do? I'm going to show you that when we are going to do the graph sign or cosine, I do need to have a constant number, which is conversion factor. I need to convert the degree to the radian. So the dollar sign, you might want to say you don't need to use dollar sign when you have dollar sign too much to work. Just use F4. Just click on that cell and click on F4. It directly gives you. But some computer may be, laptop may be different. If it doesn't work, use F4. They use function. You use F. F4. It goes together. I have several different computers. Some I have to use this. And then you have the absolute address. OK. So next, I will see when on rotation. That you see here. When we say rotation, we have A1 rotation. When is A1 rotation? Did you see here? A1 rotation means the relative address. This one. Sorry. This refers to one type of rotation. This refers to another type of rotation. But by default, Excel just use this A1 rotation. And this one is not default. R1 and C1. Not default. I'm going to show you here. Now, R1, C1 rotation, if you click here on the right side, use here, use option, use formula. Then you will see here. That's what you see. R1, C1, reference. But usually, we don't do that. OK. Just to let you know, this is the option. But we don't really use that. But you might wonder why we don't use it. Why do we need to use this? When you do the markup, and the markup express this address using the R1, C1 location for you to operate this thing. OK. So we said in A1 location, you have absolute and relative reference. Absolute use dollar sign. And now, look at these case. R1, C1, R refers to row, row number, column number. So this still refers to A1. They are corresponding to C. This is row one and column one. But now, we have these. When you look at here, sorry, this reference in here can be represented as this. And as all these spaces just as that, like R2, C3. And here, you have the bracket here. And the bracket here now, inside, you have M and N, which is the number. And in here is the relative one. And this one is absolute one. This one is relative one. Relative one means you can do IJ, IJ. You can operate. You can write your code to do a lot of things. OK. So now, I have these. Now, how do you know each corresponds to each? Like R2, C4. What does that correspond to A1 location? First, this 2 and 4 means they are absolute value. They don't have the bracket. So absolute value corresponding to the total sign. Row 2 then corresponds here. Column 4, column 4, A, B, C, D. So that's D. So that's how equivalent in the two locations. OK. Now, question. I have a question here. F13 in R1, C1 location, what will be? What will be the cell address in here? So rows will be should be what? Rows will be should be 13. So should be R13. And column F, 1, C, D, C, D. So 6, 9. So that's how you wanted to see what is the address of these in R1, C1 location. Then you should know, should be able to write what would be corresponding number. And what would be first? This is absolute value corresponding to the total absolute value. So you just write R, what? Rows 13, C, 6. And now look up here. This one refers to relative or absolute? Relative, because you have bracket. And in A1 and location. And then we don't need to have dollar sign. So column 4 is D. So it should be D. And so it should be D5. And so that's how you do each. Now how do you create formula? How do you create formula in A1 itself? And I'm going to use all of these. You always start with equal sign. Then multiplication, division, power is correct. And the compatibilization is use string, use unsolved. And always you start with equal sign. Now that's what I have here now you can see. In this C3, C3 equal S2RT is the function for square root. Square root A3 square is this square plus E3 square. And then you use n time. And it will be cut. Then you copy down to here. That's how you do it there. And that's the steps here. You probably see here, square root. I don't have that. I just copy it. So you just equal this. See, why does it rewrite? You just have to equal. That's QRT. When I'm going to put as QRT then you just place to this. So it will give you then root, character, and class. And that's E3, and then part, and then two, parentheses. So that's how you do. And these are the two different signs, QRT and also the signs of multiplications. And that's functions. Now, many of these given functions, mathematical function or sub-economic functions, and as you can see some, average minimum mathematical count, quantity, and sine, cosine, tangent, and square root, absolute value, logarithm, and expansion, more, more, rather, rather you turn, long, you run up, run down. And PMT. PMT, you will be using PMT. You will be using PMT function to find the mortgage in your assignment number one. And we look. We look up, we look up, and match. These are all useful functions, the sum if and average if. And these are the functions sometimes you need to use. OK, so now in here, in here correspond to how do you do this. Here's the explanation for the formula, I mean, A1 and R1, C1. I mean, R1, C1 formula. Sorry, this should be R1, C1 formula. And this corresponds to write something in the cell A2, write something in the cell A2. If it's equal to B5 plus 2, then if on R1, C1 notation, what do you do? So you need to see what is B5 relative to A2? What is B5? What is B5? B5 should be here. A2 should be here. So you should, you want to move right side by one column, move down by one, two, three. So thus, you move down three, you move column by one. Right side we use plus sign, and going down we use plus sign. Left side we use negative. Up we use negative. That's why if we go through here, at E3 position, if you write it in E3 position to the equation of this, then correspond to the R1, C1 formula with this. This all refers to virtual cells right now to sit on. See here. And B2 is on the left side, right? So that's the reason. Because this is column shifted to the left by three. And we shift rows to the up by one, so we have minus one. And for here, and we only have the column to shift. See here, column shift by one, but rows no shift. So no shift, you don't need to write. But you don't need to just, zero you don't need to write. And then sum. And sum, if sum be general, this is the sum in the A1 notation. If I want to see sum of the number here from C1 to C5. See sum, C1 to C5. Okay. Then, okay, then in this notation, and it's in the same column. And so you don't, you have column, just column C. But it's more up. More up by five. Two more up by one. So starting from here to here. So that's minus five, and then minus one. And that's how we do it. But if in the same column, you don't even need to write column. Just write that. That's all fine. So that's how you can understand the different communications. Okay, those are the most common sale errors here. After you want to see. So we have different errors, as you can see here. Not horrible. Different size. Different size corresponds with different meaning of errors in Excel. You might see some multiple choice questions regarding this. Giving you what is the sign correspond, what meaning of that. Asking you to select. Standing for that. Like here, not available. And A, not available. And invalid. If you have quantizer of these, where is this exclamation? Invalid. As you see here, with this invalid. Now means not. So empty valid. And division by zero, as you can see. And couldn't find name, you see? Question mark. Couldn't find name. And couldn't find the reference. No reference. And invalid. And this one, if you see this, you really just drag to the right side. The color of the waves is too small. Just drag to the right side. Then you can see it. Couldn't display values. Now. For example here. This one, actually, I'm showing you ways we look. We look up. We look up. You might use we look up in the future. In your work. If you use Excel, you don't use VBA. We look up the function as lookup value. So on the first column, you see here, this is the formula you write. V lookup. I have this ID and name. Gender. Age. Now if I wish to use one column, the first column, to find the rest of information. For example, I want to type 205. Then I want to know what is the name. In the case you have so many sirens, sirens, you couldn't look. You want to use this, right? So that's the L7. Means I want to look up this number. Relative of the names of that. Should be this one, right? So where do you want to look? You want to look at this range. So that's the range. You look. Then what is the column? Which information you want to look? You want to look at column two. One, two. So you want to look at the names. Force means exact match. Exact match. So that's how you do. And then you have this, and then you can find this. But in the case of here, you couldn't. Because we had a long of here. Base. Let's see. This one. See here. See here. I have the red. Because the range, I used the wrong range. I was supposed to use the range of here, right? So that's why it shows wrong range. Then next is the values. If you use the values, invalid value, it comes out. This is the values. If you use the values, invalid value, because in here, I have this amount, which is quantity times price times. But here, I have a string. Then, of course, I have arrow. And so on. You can check all of these. And I have all the reasons. And this is a typo. If I have a typo, then it means. Because now, what is this? Average. Average is supposed to have average. I type a wrong function. It should have an e, right? So you couldn't. So that's a typo. So so on. And this one is divided by 0. And this one, you see things. Couldn't see. Just drive to here, you can see. You see? You couldn't see. So these are the values. And this one is missing. It's missing the common sign. So I couldn't have that. And this one, you do have a sign. And now, what about this? Invalid number. And because now square root, you have a negative, right? So of course, you don't have. So these are, now let's go back. These are the settings. Now, these are the errors. You can just take a look. Now, next is how we are going to do manually if you're in create this. We first want to manually create this graph. Then we're going to do a macro. And manually, you want to do that. And now, I'm going to close first. I'm going to create the, okay? Now, first, as you can see on the left slides, and it's, you open and you, of course, first, you want to add these settings, right? Add these title and degree, just write the degree to the, what is this? This is conversion, degree to the reading. So what did I write? I write pi and divide by 180 degrees. That should be the absolute scale you need. Then I need theta, 80 degrees. If you couldn't find theta, you can just highlight this and select it to symbol for this one. Q actually is symbol for theta. So you can write beautifully all these just to type the settings there, okay? Now, next is I need to input the degrees, right? And degree, I can put zero and five, and next should be 10 and 15, right? But you don't want to do, you want to auto-fill, right? So auto-fill, how do you auto-fill? You just highlight them two such that you let, you still know you want to increment by five, right? And then you look at the right side of this and fill handle. You see here I put my mouse and, see here, I put my mouse to here, right bottom, so you choose plus sign, plus sign which is a handle. Then you just use these. Oops, sorry. Sorry. I must missed. This is very good. Okay. You have to have these, not losing them. Okay. See here. So it's automatically towards here. Now towards here, I need to write a degree to the rating. So I want to equal, first equal this one higher than this. This number is not good enough because if you want to use these, and for the first number it's good, and for the next number I will just copyright value because of what? They try to find the number in here because whenever you shift, whenever you here, you find the number here, and here they find the number here. And if you go moving down, you're moving down, right? So it doesn't work. So that's invalid number because this is three. So, you know, that's the reason now you need absolute value. It doesn't change the scale. So now you put out four. My out four doesn't work. Let's see my out four. I use function fn in here. So now I would be good. See here. I would be all good. Now if you don't want to, now if you do, you would be all attractive here, right? But now you take your time, right? I'm going to show you next to how to do that. So we continue to here equal sign. This one would be sign, then this angle, and then cosine, then this angle. Then I want to just write one more of these square plus this square, oh, sorry, square equal. Oh, sorry. I should use c. I should use d. So now I'm having equation formula there. Now I want it to auto-field. How do we auto-field? You can just aim here to select and see the left of these three. Two will. Two e, 75. I'm going to use the two c. Left side, you know. Oh, that's not it. That's only, I already taught. I'm going to use the two next to each other. So that's what I have done so far. Next, drag to everything. Now I want to do auto-field. How do you do auto-field? You just use control-t, and this is e, 75. And you need to use enter. Enter to select, then control-d. Give it all. That's it. That's how you can do. Then next. Let us look at the left side. Then you select bridges just to plot, right? Just plot. Select a region that you insert towards here. Chart, use here. Right. It will give you. And then use design. Design first, add a chart element. You can do the x and y. And also you can add a legend and so on. That's how you do the graph. And this is the title. And this is x, y. You can write at this. This is the legend. You can move actually. You can move. Now, and also you can change this number by doing that. Right here. You can change here. Now next, I'm going to show you. So this is the graph. And next I'm going to. Okay. On the left side, I do have more to show you. If you're doing this, select left-b, this is three. It will show you the rating. I'm rating, but if I wish to show you the rating, it should be here. And then if you wish to change each of the sign. You see here. You can change this to A. A, you can just change it here. See here. And change this one, wouldn't be good. So, because this number will be degree, right? And that's how you make a change. You can change from the degree to there to use the number here. Okay. And also if you want to add a legend, you can add a legend here. You see here. A in the front of here, you just type all these double quotes with your legend. That's how you look the difference. Right? Okay. So that's how you. The reason why I want to, I dare use this range. Starting from B because the X is B. If I use A, X is A, but it will give me three curve. Then that curve will give, which I don't. You can do that, then you delete that curve. You can do this. Right? It will show you three. And with one that is linear for the first one, then you delete that to give you the next two. Right? And you can do all the different things by trying to do the different work. Did you see here? Because it's all starting from the first column as your class. Right? So you just delete the other one. Delete this one. Linear curve as the degree. See? Right. That's how you do differences. Okay. And finally, okay. So that's how you do. And next I'm going to show you how to recall micro. And now first you want to protect your sheet. How do you protect your sheet? And you use the protect your sheet view review. In the review. It's in the review. On the website in the review you have protect. So now you just protect click okay. Now I cannot do anything. You just cannot do anything. Because it's protected. Now I'm protected. Okay. Now you can rename as I said. You can rename here, just here rename. Right? And you can add nodes. Add nodes is just in here. And insert. So you can add text box. If you want to add text box it's here. And so on you can format cells. If you want to see here, just right click format cells. And you can go to different numbers. See here. Will not give you too many numbers. Right? And so on. You can do many of the things. You can highlight. Highlight column or rows. If I want to highlight this. No no. Hide. You cannot see. So that's how you hide. You can also hide sheet. And insert column. Just go in here. Insert. Okay. And now I'm going to come back. Unhide. Unhide. Unhide. Unhide. Right. Unhide. So. And also if you copy a worksheet. If you want to say okay I want to copy. If you're doing something you don't want me to do. Then you copy here. You see here. Let's copy exactly the same. So you can play with the other sheet. Right? And then that's. Next. She's name. And she's. Insert worksheet. Yeah. Insert worksheet as I said. You're just doing that. It's insert worksheet. Just using this. Then. We want to do macro. What you want to do. You see here. Hmm. In here. In here. In here. In here. In here. In here. In here. In here. In here. In here. In here. In here. Okay. First I'm going to do copy this. Because I don't want to miss. I want to save time. I want to save time. Okay. Yeah. I did copy here. Then now you do. Now I copy here. Now I'm going to do the macro. So whenever you do the macro. You see here. In the dev app. On the left side. Then you go to the dev app. Recall. You see here. Recall. Recall. Recall. Recall. Recall. Recall. Recall. Recall. Recall. Recall. Okay. Recall. Okay. Recall the macro. This is my command. Just click okay. Then now it's recording. Whatever you're doing. It's something. It will automatically write code in the dev app. So what I want to do first. I'm going to do what? Select this first. Select first cell. Then I put a zero. Then I put a five. Right? Then I select this. To five. Then final handle. Then copy that to seventy five. To three hundred sixty. Three hundred sixty. Then I'm going to here to write equation of. Use this number. And after four. After four. And times. This equal. Then use these. Sign. This number. And then cosine. This. And then equal. This square. Oh no sorry. This square. Square plus. This square. Equal. I'm done. Now I'm going to select this. So B3. Then E. Seventy five. Enter. Then control D. That's it. I'm done with this. So I'm stop. Recording. So I'm done now. I already stop. So now if you look at VBA here now. You supposed to see here. You do have automatically generate module. As you can see here. Okay. And it will give you what did you do. And what's the results. You see here. The notation. So I'm going to you see the left. Now you're going to see the left. And now you do. These are the code inside here. Now. If you don't. Now if you want to. You want to run this code. You need to go here. Insert. Control button. Right. So you have plus sign. And then you just use your mouse to. Then connect. Connect them to the module 1. This module 1 is your code. Right. So. That's the 1. And then you can change. Wrong button. Wrong program. That's how you can do. Now I can. We can. Just test this. So we just clear content. We don't have anything right. That's what we have to do. Right. Then we just. Click it. It's there. So that's how you want. Of course here the plot. The graph is. If you already have the graph. Then it graph will show. Right. If the graph is showing there directly. Then it will show. Let me just use this. Let me just use this quickly. The graph. That. Insert. The graph. Right. And just keep quickly. Just. I'm not going to make it beautiful. Just like that. Right. Now I'm going to. Clear. Then. I'm going to do wrong button. Just click on the button. Wrong. Right. That's how it can automatically work. Here. And you can. As I said. You can change your wrong button. And then. And the explanation. Of here. Of the code. You can check whatever code. It will give. To. Relative to what. Okay. So now. Finally. Finally. Finally. What. Marguerite can do. What cannot do. This automatically in your work. If you want to do. You can. You can. Do. Right. And. But. However. Can we do. It. No. You cannot. So you have to. We have to. Learn. How to. Right. And. You. Are. Going to. Let's. You. Know. You. Right. And. Right. And. You. Are. Going to. Learn. This. And. You. Right. To. Find. The. Most. Great. Even. The constant. Great. So you need to use. The absolute. Right. And. You need to do the. The right. Form. Right. And. To. Do. The. Calculation. And. Also. You need to. Input. One number. Like. A. Rate. From. Where to where. From like. 2%. To. 5%. Then. You want to see. Your loans. If you want to loan a car. Like. Ten. Ten thousand. Pay. That. You need to pay. Months. For how many years. You need to pay. You need to pay. For how many years. You need to pay. For how many years. If you want to get the car. Or the car. Or. That. You need to pay. For how many years. You need to pay. For how many years. And. So. When you do it. So that's. We'll be. Your first. Assignment. Will be. Putting. Your. Dropbox. And assignment. In assignment. For the school. A couple of days. Right. And so.
