# Group Dynamics & Development Models  
**TL;DR** – A *group* is any set of two or more interdependent individuals working toward a common goal. A *team* is a task‑oriented subgroup of a group that shares responsibility and accountability. Two key development models explain how groups evolve:  
1. **Tuckman’s Five‑Stage Model** – forming → storming → norming → performing → adjourning.  
2. **Gursick’s Punctuated Equilibrium Model** – initial planning, a midpoint shift, and a final rush to finish.

## Key Concepts
- **Interaction** – the most basic element of a group.  
- **Interdependence** – members rely on and influence each other.  
- **Common Goal** – shared objective that drives the group.  
- **Task Interdependence** – a distinguishing feature of teams.  
- **Shared Responsibility** – teams hold each other accountable for outcomes.  
- **Group Development Models** – frameworks that describe typical stages or patterns of group evolution.  
- **Group Size & Task Type** – determine how group performance scales.  
- **Social Loafing** – reduced effort by individuals in larger groups.

## Important Definitions
- **Group** – *two or more individuals who interact interdependently to achieve a common goal.*  
- **Team** – *a small group that works closely together on a task‑related purpose, is held accountable to one another, and has a shared objective.*  
- **Task Interdependence** – *members rely on each other to complete tasks.*  
- **Shared Responsibility** – *collective accountability for outcomes.*  
- **Adjourning** – *the final stage where a temporary group disbands.*  
- **Punctuated Equilibrium** – *a pattern of stability, a midpoint shift, and a final burst of activity in temporary teams.*

## Step‑by‑Step Explanations

### 1. Tuckman’s Five‑Stage Model  
| Stage | What Happens | Typical Characteristics |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Forming** | Members orient, test boundaries, seek clarity on roles and expectations. | Uncertainty, anxiety, polite behavior. |
| **Storming** | Conflict over power, status, and ideas. | Hostilities, resistance to accommodation, potential threat to group existence. |
| **Norming** | Agreement on goals, norms, and roles. | Cohesion, closer relationships, cooperative behavior. |
| **Performing** | Focus shifts to task execution; roles are clear and efficient. | High productivity, goal attainment. |
| **Adjourning** | Temporary teams disband; members reflect and move on. | Closure, celebration, or transition to new teams. |

> **Note:** Not all groups go through every stage, especially if members already know each other or if time is limited (e.g., pilots).

### 2. Gursick’s Punctuated Equilibrium Model  
| Phase | Description | Key Actions |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1 – Initial Meeting** | Set agenda, plan, but little progress is made. | Role setting, exploration, early decisions stick. |
| **Midpoint Transition** | Re‑evaluate approach, adjust plans. | Reflect, plan, renew focus. |
| **Phase 2 – Rush to Finish** | Execute plans, accelerate work, prepare final product. | Ensure resources, avoid deadline changes. |
| **Final Meeting** | Review outcomes, consider evaluation. | Final adjustments, presentation. |

> **Contextual Tip:** For temporary teams with deadlines, the midpoint shift is critical; failure to manage it can derail the project.

## Examples (Illustrated in Lecture)

| Example | Task Type | Group Size | Outcome Implications |
|---------|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Marketing a new product** | Additive | Small (4–5) | More members → faster, better results if coordinated. |
| **Group presentation** | Conjunctive (needs all to finish) | Small | Weakest link can delay entire project. |
| **Building a house** | Additive | Many carpenters | Sum of individual efforts → faster construction. |
| **Escape room** | Disjunctive | Small | Success depends on one sharp member; larger group increases chance of having such a member. |
| **Assembly line** | Conjunctive | Many workers | Weakest link slows entire line; training/support needed. |
| **Dating analogy** | Personal relationship | Two | Stages mirror forming, storming, norming, performing, adjourning. |
