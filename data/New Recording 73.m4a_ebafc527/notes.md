# Group Dynamics & Motivation – Exam‑Ready Notes  

**TL;DR** – The lecture covered how team size, diversity, and process losses (coordination & motivational) affect performance, the psychology of social loafing, groupthink, and polarization, and how motivation is defined, measured, and theorized (content vs. process). It also reviewed Maslow’s hierarchy, its assumptions, and criticisms.

## Key Concepts  

- **Team Size & Performance** – Larger teams can increase output (additive tasks) or improve chance of best performance (disjunctive tasks) but also raise *process loss*.  
- **Process Loss** – The gap between potential and actual team performance.  
  - *Motivational loss* (social loafing).  
  - *Coordination loss* (inefficient organization).  
- **Social Loafing** – Individuals exert less effort in a group because they feel less accountable.  
- **Groupthink & Polarization** – Consensus pressure can lead to flawed decisions; group discussion can amplify initial positions.  
- **Process Gains** – Synergy where team output exceeds the sum of individual outputs.  
- **Team States** – Norms, status symbols, potency, cohesion, mental mode.  
- **Motivation** – Persistent effort directed toward a goal; inferred, not directly observable.  
- **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation** – Internal desire vs. external rewards.  
- **Content Theories** – Focus on *needs* that drive motivation (Maslow, ERG, McClelland, SDT).  
- **Process Theories** – Focus on *how* motivation unfolds (e.g., expectancy‑value, goal‑setting).  
- **Maslow’s Hierarchy** – Five needs: physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, self‑actualization.  
- **Assumptions of Maslow** – *Prepotency* (lowest unsatisfied need dominates) & *Invariant order*.  
- **Criticisms** – Lack of empirical support; needs may co‑occur and vary across individuals.

## Important Definitions  

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Process Loss** | The difference between a team’s potential performance and its actual performance. |
| **Motivational Loss** | Loss due to social loafing; team members exert less effort. |
| **Coordination Loss** | Loss due to poor organization, role confusion, or tool shortages. |
| **Social Loafing** | Tendency of individuals to reduce effort when working in a group. |
| **Groupthink** | Decision‑making process that prioritizes harmony over critical evaluation. |
| **Group Polarization** | Tendency for group discussion to amplify initial individual positions. |
| **Process Gain** | Synergy where team output exceeds the sum of individual outputs. |
| **Team State** | Psychological conditions (norms, status symbols, potency, cohesion) that influence team functioning. |
| **Motivation** | Extent to which persistent effort is directed toward a goal. |
| **Intrinsic Motivation** | Internal desire to perform an activity for its own sake. |
| **Extrinsic Motivation** | Motivation driven by external rewards or pressures. |
| **Content Theory** | Theory that identifies needs that must be met to motivate individuals. |
| **Process Theory** | Theory that explains how motivation is generated and sustained. |
| **Maslow’s Hierarchy** | Five ordered needs: physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, self‑actualization. |
| **Prepotency** | Assumption that the lowest unsatisfied need dominates behavior. |
| **Invariant Order** | Assumption that needs are satisfied in a fixed sequence. |

## Step‑by‑Step Explanations  

### 1. How Team Size Affects Performance  
1. **Additive Tasks** – Output increases linearly with team size.  
2. **Disjunctive Tasks** – Success probability rises with more members.  
3. **Reality Check** – Larger teams can suffer from coordination & motivational losses.  
4. **Optimal Size** – Balance diversity & skill against process loss.

### 2. Process Loss Breakdown  
1. **Identify Potential Performance** – Sum of individual capabilities.  
2. **Measure Actual Performance** – Team output.  
3. **Calculate Loss** – Potential – Actual.  
4. **Diagnose Causes**  
   - *Motivational Loss*: Social loafing.  
   - *Coordination Loss*: Role confusion, tool shortages.

### 3. Counteracting Social Loafing  
1. **Increase Visibility** – Make individual performance observable.  
2. **Assign Specialized Tasks** – Unique roles reduce overlap.  
3. **Set Individual Goals** – Clear expectations.  
4. **Provide Feedback** – Regular performance updates.  
5. **Ensure Intrinsic Interest** – Make work meaningful.  
6. **Reward Group Performance** – Align incentives with team success.

### 4. Motivation Components  
1. **Effort** – How much work is put in.  
2. **Persistence** – Consistency of effort over time.  
3. **Direction** – Alignment of effort with organizational goals.

### 5. Maslow’s Hierarchy Application  
1. **Identify Needs** – Physiological → Safety → Love/Belonging → Esteem → Self‑Actualization.  
2. **Assess Satisfaction** – Determine which needs are unmet.  
3. **Prioritize Interventions** – Address lower‑level needs first (per theory).  
4. **Critique** – Recognize that needs may overlap and not follow a strict order.

## Examples (with timestamps if mentioned)  

- **Social Loafing Study (1974)** – Participants pulled a rope; those told they were in a group exerted 18 % less force.  
- **Groupthink Scenario** – Class project where team members avoided risky ideas to maintain harmony.  
- **Group Polarization Example** – Debate on a controversial topic where initial opinions became more extreme after discussion.  
- **Motivation Exercise** – Students compared working for themselves vs. for someone else; discussion highlighted intrinsic vs. extrinsic drivers.
