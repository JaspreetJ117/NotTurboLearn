# Co‑Op Fundamentals – Module 1  
**TL;DR** – The first module introduces the co‑op program, its purpose, and the resources you’ll need.  Key take‑aways: understand the difference between co‑op and internships, develop resilience and adaptability, use the Navigator portal and MyLearningSpaces, attend the required speaker series, and follow the speaker‑series policy to avoid “free strikes.”

## Key Concepts
- **Co‑op vs. Internship** – Co‑op is a *full‑time* paid work term (≥ 35 hrs/week) that aligns with your studies; internships are typically unpaid or part‑time.  
- **Professional Attributes** – Resilience, adaptability, initiative, and punctuality are essential for success.  
- **Peer Mentors** – Senior students who provide one‑on‑one support (resume, cover letter, interview prep).  
- **Co‑op Consultants** – 14 staff who work directly with employers and students; they run drop‑in hours and manage the co‑op portal.  
- **Speaker Series** – At least **four** events (purple & gold, labeled SPK) that count toward your course; recorded events count as one.  
- **Co‑op Portal (Navigator)** – Central hub for course modules, event calendar, job applications, interview schedules, and document submissions.  
- **MyLearningSpaces (MyLS)** – LMS for course syllabus, assignments, and work‑term reports.  
- **Code of Conduct & Admission Conditions** – Must be read; failure can lead to removal from co‑op.  
- **International Students** – Must apply for a work permit within two weeks of admission to co‑op.

## Important Definitions
- **Co‑op** – A structured, paid work term that is part of your degree program.  
- **Early CPA Round** – Fast‑track recruitment for public accounting firms (mid‑November start, 6‑week sprint).  
- **Sequence 1 / Sequence 2** – Cohort groupings that determine when you apply and start work terms.  
- **Drop‑in Hours** – Scheduled times when consultants or peer mentors are available for in‑person help.  
- **Free Strike** – A penalty for missing a speaker‑series event without cancelling 24 hrs in advance.
