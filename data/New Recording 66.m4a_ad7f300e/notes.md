# Lecture Notes – Learning & Social‑Cognitive Processes  
**TL;DR** – The lecture covered *learning theory* (operant conditioning, reinforcement, punishment, extinction), *social‑cognitive theory* (observational learning, self‑efficacy, self‑regulation), and *attribution theory* (dispositional vs. situational). Key take‑aways:  
- **Reinforcement** (positive/negative) increases behavior; **punishment** and **extinction** decrease it.  
- **Social‑cognitive theory** explains learning through observation, self‑efficacy, and self‑regulation.  
- **Attribution** uses consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness to decide if a cause is internal or external.

## Key Concepts
- **Learning** – a relatively permanent change in behavior potential, driven by feedback.  
- **Operant Conditioning** – learning through consequences (rewards/punishments).  
- **Reinforcement** – increases the probability of a behavior.  
  - *Positive Reinforcement*: add a pleasant stimulus.  
  - *Negative Reinforcement*: remove an unpleasant stimulus.  
- **Punishment** – adds an unpleasant stimulus to reduce a behavior.  
- **Extinction** – removes the reinforcer; the behavior fades over time.  
- **Social‑Cognitive Theory** – learning via observation, self‑efficacy, and self‑regulation.  
- **Observational Learning** – imitating others; best when models are credible, attractive, competent, and memorable.  
- **Self‑Efficacy** – belief in one’s ability; derived from mastery, observation, verbal persuasion, and physiological state.  
- **Self‑Regulation** – goal‑setting, monitoring, discrepancy reduction/production.  
- **Attribution Theory** – assigning causes to behavior; two types: dispositional (internal) vs. situational (external).  
- **Attribution Criteria** – consensus, consistency, distinctiveness.

## Important Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Learning** | A relatively permanent change in behavior potential resulting from practice or experience. |
| **Operant Conditioning** | Learning that occurs when a behavior is followed by a consequence that either reinforces or punishes it. |
| **Positive Reinforcement** | Adding a pleasant stimulus after a behavior to increase its future occurrence. |
| **Negative Reinforcement** | Removing an unpleasant stimulus after a behavior to increase its future occurrence. |
| **Punishment** | Adding an unpleasant stimulus after a behavior to decrease its future occurrence. |
| **Extinction** | The gradual disappearance of a behavior when its reinforcer is removed. |
| **Observational Learning** | Learning by watching and imitating others. |
| **Self‑Efficacy** | Confidence in one’s ability to perform a task. |
| **Self‑Regulation** | The process of setting goals, monitoring performance, and adjusting behavior to achieve goals. |
| **Dispositional Attribution** | Explaining behavior by internal traits or characteristics. |
| **Situational Attribution** | Explaining behavior by external circumstances or context. |
| **Consensus** | Whether others behave similarly in the same situation. |
| **Consistency** | Whether the person behaves the same way across time. |
| **Distinctiveness** | Whether the behavior is unique to a particular situation. |

## Step‑by‑Step Explanations

### 1. Operant Conditioning Cycle
1. **Behavior** occurs.  
2. **Consequence** follows (reward or punishment).  
3. **Feedback** shapes future behavior:  
   - *Positive outcome* → behavior more likely.  
   - *Negative outcome* → behavior less likely.

### 2. Reinforcement Types
| Type | How it works | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Positive Reinforcement** | Add a pleasant stimulus after the behavior. | Praise after a student answers correctly. |
| **Negative Reinforcement** | Remove an unpleasant stimulus after the behavior. | Sunglasses stop glare after wearing them. |

### 3. Punishment & Extinction
- **Punishment**: Add an unpleasant stimulus → decreases behavior.  
  *Example*: Detention after talking out of turn.  
- **Extinction**: Remove the reinforcer → behavior fades.  
  *Example*: Stop giving bonuses for unethical competition → unethical behavior declines.

### 4. Social‑Cognitive Theory Components
1. **Observational Learning** – imitate credible, attractive, competent models.  
2. **Self‑Efficacy** – belief built from mastery, observation, persuasion, physiological state.  
3. **Self‑Regulation** –  
   - *Discrepancy Reduction*: Notice gap between goal & performance → adjust behavior.  
   - *Discrepancy Production*: After achieving a goal, set a higher goal → continue improving.

### 5. Attribution Decision Process
1. **Consensus** – Do others act similarly?  
   - High → situational.  
   - Low → dispositional.  
2. **Consistency** – Does the person act similarly over time?  
   - High → dispositional.  
   - Low → situational.  
3. **Distinctiveness** – Is the behavior unique to this situation?  
   - High → situational.  
   - Low → dispositional.

## Examples (from lecture)

| Context | Example | Key Point |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Dog training | Treat after correct behavior (continuous vs. partial) | Fast acquisition vs. persistence |
| Student behavior | Praise after answering questions | Positive reinforcement |
| Classroom disruption | Detention after talking out of turn | Punishment |
| Unethical competition | Remove bonuses → behavior fades | Extinction |
| Observational learning | New employee watches colleague handle client | Modeling |
| Self‑efficacy | Student believes they can succeed after past success | Mastery experience |
| Self‑regulation | Student studies more after noticing gap to goal | Discrepancy reduction |
| Attribution | Student gets A because smart (dispositional) vs. exam was easy (situational) | Consensus, consistency, distinctiveness |

## Potential Exam Questions  
*(Professor mentioned these might appear on the exam)*

1. **Explain the difference between positive and negative reinforcement. Provide an example for each.**  
2. **Describe how extinction works and give a real‑world example.**  
3. **List the three components of social‑cognitive theory and explain how each contributes to learning.**  
4. **What are the three attribution criteria and how do they help determine whether an attribution is dispositional or situational?**  
5. **Why is reinforcement considered more effective than punishment?**  
6. **Illustrate the process of self‑regulation using the concepts of discrepancy reduction and discrepancy production.**  
7. **Give an example of observational learning and explain why the model’s credibility matters.**  
8. **Define self‑efficacy and identify its four sources of information.**

> **Note:** The professor emphasized that *reinforcement is more effective than punishment* and that students should focus on the definitions of reinforcement, punishment, extinction, and the attribution criteria. These points are likely to be tested.
