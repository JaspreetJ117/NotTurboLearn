# Personal Branding & Job‑Search Strategies  
**TL;DR** – The lecture explains how to *position* yourself, craft a concise *intro pitch*, and *tailor* resumes and cover letters to specific job descriptions. It stresses the importance of storytelling, distinguishing soft vs. hard skills, and managing imposter syndrome. The key is to present a *unique, authentic narrative* that aligns with employer expectations and ATS requirements.

## Key Concepts
- **Personal Brand** – The identity you manage so others perceive you in a specific way.  
- **Positioning** – Selecting which experiences to highlight to match a target role.  
- **Intro Pitch** – A 30‑40 second statement that covers who you are, what you’re passionate about, a key strength, and your vision.  
- **Resume/cover‑letter tailoring** – Using keywords from the job description and aligning your stories with the employer’s needs.  
- **Soft vs. Hard Skills** – Soft: teamwork, communication, problem‑solving; Hard: Excel, programming, financial modeling.  
- **ATS (Applicant Tracking System)** – Software that scans resumes for keywords before a human sees them.  
- **Imposter Syndrome** – Feeling you’re not good enough or that you’re “faking it.”

- **Positioning** – *Choosing which of your experiences to present so they align with the employer’s expectations.*  
- **Soft Skill** – *Non‑technical ability that influences how you work with others (e.g., communication, teamwork).*  
- **Hard Skill** – *Technical, measurable ability (e.g., Excel, SQL, Java).*  
- **ATS** – *Applicant Tracking System; software that parses resumes for keyword matches.*  
- **Imposter Syndrome** – *A set of feelings that you’re not competent enough, often manifesting as perfectionism, fear of speaking up, or feeling “superhuman.”*

## Step‑by‑Step Explanations

### 1. Crafting a 30‑Second Intro Pitch
| Step | What to Say | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Identify yourself** | Name + program | “Hi, I’m Ian, a BBA student.” |
| **2. Share a passion** | Something relatable | “I love food because it brings people together.” |
| **3. Highlight a key strength** | One skill with evidence | “I’m strong at assessment; I review 200+ resumes a year.” |
| **4. State your vision** | Short future goal | “I want to learn authentic networking strategies.” |
| **5. Wrap up** | Quick closing | “That’s a bit about me.” |

### 2. Positioning Yourself for a Job
1. **Read the job description** → note hard/soft skills.  
2. **Match your experiences** → pick stories that demonstrate those skills.  
3. **Tailor the resume** → use the same keywords, reorder bullet points.  
4. **Write a focused cover letter** → 1–2 stories that align with the role.  
5. **Prepare interview answers** → practice “Tell me about yourself” with the same story structure.

### 3. Using Stories to Show Skills
- **Gardener example**  
  - *Skill:* Organization  
  - *Story:* “I planned the garden layout, sourced seeds, and scheduled watering to keep plants healthy.”  
- **Subway server example**  
  - *Skill:* Communication  
  - *Story:* “I memorized daily specials and explained ingredient sourcing to customers with dietary restrictions.”  
- **Case competition example**  
  - *Skill:* Data analysis  
  - *Story:* “I used Excel to forecast revenue from the last three years of sales data.”  

### 4. Managing Imposter Syndrome
1. **Identify the feeling** – e.g., perfectionism, fear of speaking up.  
2. **Ask if it helps or hurts** – is it motivating or paralyzing?  
3. **Seek feedback** – from peers, mentors, or office hours.  
4. **Reframe** – view challenges as learning opportunities.  
5. **Document successes** – keep a “wins” log to counter negative self‑talk.
