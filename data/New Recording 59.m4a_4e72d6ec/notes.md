# Lecture Notes – Organizational Behavior Research & Ethics  
**TL;DR** – The lecture covered the *Hawthorne effect*, the difference between **correlational** and **experimental** designs, how to interpret a correlation coefficient (direction & strength), and the concepts of **internal** vs **external validity**. It also reviewed key **ethical principles** (informed consent, deception, anonymity, confidentiality, voluntary participation, no‑harm) and briefly touched on personality in OB.

## Key Concepts

- **Hawthorne Effect** – Participants change behavior because they know they are being studied, not because of the experimental manipulation.  
- **Correlational Design** – Measures variables without manipulation; identifies *association* but not *causation*.  
- **Experimental Design** – Manipulates an independent variable (IV) while controlling other factors; can infer causation.  
- **Correlation Coefficient (r)** – Numeric value from –1 to +1 indicating *direction* (positive/negative) and *strength* of association.  
- **Internal Validity** – Confidence that changes in the dependent variable (DV) are due to the IV, not confounds.  
- **External Validity** – Generalizability of findings to other people, settings, or times.  
- **Random Sampling & Random Assignment** – Techniques to enhance representativeness and internal validity.  
- **Control Group** – Receives no treatment; used to isolate the effect of the IV.

## Important Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Hawthorne Effect** | Behavioral change by participants due to awareness of being observed. |
| **Correlation Coefficient (r)** | A statistic ranging from –1 to +1 that quantifies the linear relationship between two variables. |
| **Internal Validity** | The extent to which a study can rule out alternative explanations for observed effects. |
| **External Validity** | The degree to which study results can be generalized beyond the specific context. |
| **Random Sampling** | Selecting participants from a population in a way that each member has an equal chance of being chosen. |
| **Random Assignment** | Randomly allocating participants to experimental or control groups. |
| **Control Group** | The group that does not receive the experimental manipulation. |
| **Informed Consent** | Participants’ voluntary agreement to partake after being fully informed of the study’s purpose and procedures. |
| **Deception** | Withholding or misrepresenting information to participants, used only when necessary and justified. |
| **Anonymity** | Removing identifiers so participants cannot be linked to their data. |
| **Confidentiality** | Ensuring that data are only accessible to authorized researchers. |
| **No‑Harm Principle** | Researchers must avoid physical, psychological, or emotional harm to participants. |

## Step‑by‑Step Explanations

### 1. Hawthorne Effect
1. Participants are aware they are part of a study.  
2. They receive extra attention or feel special.  
3. Their behavior changes (e.g., increased productivity).  
4. The change is **not** due to the experimental manipulation (e.g., lighting).  

### 2. Correlational Design
1. **Select** variables to measure (e.g., supervisor friendliness & employee productivity).  
2. **Collect** data via surveys, interviews, or existing records.  
3. **Compute** correlation coefficient \( r \).  
4. **Interpret** direction (positive/negative) and strength (weak, moderate, strong).  
5. **Note**: No causal inference can be made.  

### 3. Experimental Design
1. **Formulate** hypothesis (e.g., friendly supervisors → higher productivity).  
2. **Randomly sample** participants from the target population.  
3. **Randomly assign** participants to:
   - **Experimental group** (receive friendly‑supervisor training).  
   - **Control group** (no training).  
4. **Manipulate** the IV (training).  
5. **Measure** DV (productivity).  
6. **Analyze** differences between groups.  
7. **Infer** causation if internal validity is high.  

### 4. Validity Assessment
- **Internal Validity**: Strengthened by random assignment, control group, and manipulation of IV.  
- **External Validity**: Enhanced by random sampling and naturalistic settings (e.g., surveys).  

### 5. Ethical Conduct
1. **Obtain informed consent** (paper or digital).  
2. **Avoid unnecessary deception**; use only when justified.  
3. **Guarantee anonymity** (remove identifiers).  
4. **Maintain confidentiality** (aggregate data).  
5. **Ensure voluntary participation** (right to withdraw).  
6. **Prevent harm** (physical, psychological, emotional).

## Equations / Formulas

- **Correlation Coefficient**  
  \[
  r = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}
  \]

## Examples (with timestamps if mentioned)

| Time | Example | Key Point |
|------|---------|-----------|
| N/A | **Hawthorne Study** – Factory lighting increased productivity, but also when lights dimmed, productivity stayed high because of attention. | Demonstrates Hawthorne effect. |
| N/A | **Correlation Example** – Attendance vs. midterm grade. | Positive association; no causation. |
| N/A | **Experimental Example** – Friendly vs. unfriendly supervisor training. | Manipulation of IV to test causal effect. |

## Potential Exam Questions

1. **Multiple Choice** – What is the Hawthorne effect?  
   - A) Change in behavior due to experimental treatment  
   - B) Change in behavior due to being observed  
   - C) Increase in productivity from better lighting  
   - D) None of the above  

2. **Short Answer** – Explain the difference between *correlation* and *causation*.  

3. **True/False** – A correlation coefficient of 0.70 indicates a strong positive relationship.  

4. **Fill in the Blank** – Internal validity is the confidence that changes in the DV are due to the IV **and not** other factors.  

5. **Ethics** – List three ethical principles that must be followed when conducting research with human participants.  

6. **Design** – Outline the steps to set up an experimental study to test whether friendly supervisors increase employee productivity.

## Personality Section (Brief Overview)

- **Why Personality Matters in OB** – Personality traits influence work behavior, performance, and fit.  
- **Major Debates** – Positional, situational, and interactualist approaches.  
- **Five‑Factor Model** – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism (not fully covered in this lecture).
