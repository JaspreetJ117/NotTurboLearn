# Attribution Theory & Workplace Perception – Exam‑Ready Notes

**TL;DR**  
Attribution theory explains why we judge others’ behavior as internal (dispositional) or external (situational). Three key cues—consensus, consistency, distinctiveness—guide the attribution. Biases such as the *fundamental attribution error* and *self‑serving bias* distort these judgments. In the workplace, these shortcuts influence interviews, performance expectations, and evaluations, often leading to self‑fulfilling prophecies and biased decisions. Understanding values, attitudes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment), and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions helps predict and manage employee behavior.

## Key Concepts
- **Attribution Theory** – Explains how we explain others’ behavior.
- **Dispositional vs. Situational Attribution** – Internal vs. external causes.
- **Consensus, Consistency, Distinctiveness** – Three cues for attribution.
- **Fundamental Attribution Error** – Over‑emphasis on internal causes.
- **Self‑Serving Bias** – Attributing success to internal factors, failure to external ones.
- **Self‑Fulfilling Prophecy** – Expectations shape behavior.
- **Primacy & Recency Effects** – Early vs. late information biases.
- **Values vs. Attitudes** – Broad guiding beliefs vs. specific, evaluative responses.
- **Job Satisfaction** – Global and facet‑specific attitudes toward work.
- **Organizational Commitment** – Affective, continuous, normative forms.
- **Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions** – Power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, individualism, long‑term orientation, indulgence.

## Important Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Attribution** | Explanation of why a person behaves a certain way. |
| **Dispositional Attribution** | Internal, personality‑based cause. |
| **Situational Attribution** | External, environment‑based cause. |
| **Consensus Cue** | How many others behave similarly. |
| **Consistency Cue** | How often the person behaves the same way. |
| **Distinctiveness Cue** | How unique the behavior is to that person. |
| **Fundamental Attribution Error** | Tendency to over‑attribute others’ actions to internal traits. |
| **Self‑Serving Bias** | Tendency to attribute own successes internally, failures externally. |
| **Self‑Fulfilling Prophecy** | Expectations that influence behavior to confirm them. |
| **Primacy Effect** | Greater weight to information presented first. |
| **Recency Effect** | Greater weight to information presented last. |
| **Values** | Broad, enduring beliefs that guide evaluation of events. |
| **Attitude** | Stable, evaluative, specific response to an object or situation. |
| **Job Satisfaction** | Global or facet‑specific attitudes toward one’s job. |
| **Organizational Commitment** | Desire to remain a member of an organization. |
| **Affective Commitment** | Emotional attachment to the organization. |
| **Continuous Commitment** | Staying because of cost/benefit calculation. |
| **Normative Commitment** | Staying because of a sense of obligation. |
| **Hofstede Dimensions** | Six cultural values that differ across societies. |

## Step‑by‑Step Explanations

### 1. Making an Attribution
1. **Observe behavior** (e.g., Jenny is late).  
2. **Ask three questions**:  
   - *Consensus* – Do others behave similarly?  
   - *Consistency* – Does she always behave this way?  
   - *Distinctiveness* – Is this behavior unique to her?  
3. **Determine attribution**  
   - Low consensus, high consistency, low distinctiveness → **Dispositional**.  
   - High consensus, low consistency, high distinctiveness → **Situational**.

### 2. Biases in Attribution
- **Fundamental Attribution Error**  
  - *Example*: Jenny’s lateness → “She’s lazy” (internal) vs. “It rained” (external).  
- **Self‑Serving Bias**  
  - *Success*: “I did well because of my ability.”  
  - *Failure*: “I failed because of bad luck.”

### 3. Self‑Fulfilling Prophecy in the Workplace
1. Manager expects high performance.  
2. Employees behave in ways that confirm expectation → performance rises.  
3. Low expectation → performance drops.

### 4. Job Satisfaction Facets
| Facet | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Pay | Satisfaction with salary. |
| Promotion | Fairness of promotion process. |
| Supervision | Relationship with boss. |
| Coworker | Quality of peer relationships. |
| Work | Interest and challenge of tasks. |

### 5. Organizational Commitment Types
| Type | Core Reason | Typical Outcome |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Affective | Emotional attachment | High performance, low turnover |
| Continuous | Cost/benefit calculation | Low performance, minimal effort |
| Normative | Sense of obligation | Moderate outcomes |

## Examples (with timestamps if mentioned)
- **Jenny’s lateness** – Example of fundamental attribution error.  
- **Sales manager’s bias** – Attributing poor sales to laziness rather than product issues.  
- **Work‑life balance example** – Affective commitment reason.  
- **Audiologist at Costco** – Normative commitment example (obligation to stay due to paid education).
